In 2006, she had a role in the film Exit 38 where she played a character named Pat.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=floyd-mayweather-ex-josie-harris></span> Floyd Mayweather Ex Josie Harris<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harris reportedly dated Floyd Mayweather from 1995 to 2010. They had a tumultuous relationship. According to TMZ, Mayweather was convicted of attacking her back in a 2010 domestic violence incident and later served 2 months behind bars.</p><p>Harris went public with the abuse, alleging Mayweather had attacked her on 6 different occasions. However, Mayweather only was convicted of the September 2010 incident, which Harris accused him of entering her Las Vegas house as she slept, pulled her hair and attacked her in front of their children. According to Harris, their oldest son, Koraun Mayweather, snuck out of the home and alerted a security guard to call the police.</p><p>In a 2015 interview with Katie Couric, Mayweather claimed Harris was on drugs the night he attacked her. He told Katie Couric, “Did I kick, stomp, and beat someone? No, that didn’t happen. Did I restrain a woman that was on drugs? Yes, I did. So if they say that’s domestic violence, then, you know what? I’m guilty. I’m guilty of restraining someone.”</p><p>In 2015, Harris sued Mayweather for $20 million in damages for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p><p>In a 2017 interview with USA Today, Harris said of her relationship with Mayweather: “I was a battered woman. I felt embarrassed about saying I was a battered woman. I felt shame. I felt like it was my fault. What did I do? I didn’t understand what a battered woman was at that time. Now I know I was in a very dysfunctional, hostile relationship and a victim of domestic violence.”</p><p>According to NewsOne, Mayweather’s abuse to Harris was one of 7 assaults that he allegedly committed against five different women, each resulting in him being arrested or issued a citation. That includes his off-again fiancée Shantel Jackson, who in 2014 filed a civil lawsuit against Mayweather including allegations of battery, false imprisonment and claims that he pointed a gun at her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=josie-harris-age></span> Josie Harris Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Josie Harris was born on January 17, 1980, in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.
