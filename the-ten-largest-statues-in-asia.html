Americans might still marvel at the beautiful statue bestowed to the country by France, but Lady Liberty doesn't hold a torch to the immense, intricately created statues of China, Japan, Thailand, and Burma. Many of the statues depict Gautama Buddha, also referred to as Siddhārtha or Shakyamuni Buddha, the spiritual leader and founder of Buddhism. Thailand's Great Buddha represents Theravada, the oldest surviving branch still in practice of Buddhism. Translated to "Teachings of the Elders," the Buddhist teachings are popular in Southeastern Asian countries Thailand and Myanmar. The Asian countries share several similar statues of the 33 forms of Guanyin or Kannon; however, they don't share the same names, something that can confuse anyone without a basic understanding of Asian cultures, languages, or Buddhism. China's Guan Yin also appears as Kuan Yin, Kuan Yim, and Guan Yim, which all depict Avalokitśvara. The female form represents the embodiment of the compassion of Buddha. In Japanese Buddhism refers to her as Kannon and Thailand uses Kuan Eim. In addition, Amitabha is a popular and simplified version Buddhism that originated in second century India. Nine of the countries with the largest followers of Buddhism are located in Asia. Half of the largest statues in Asia are in China, where 102 million Buddhists live. Each unique statue rests on a pedestal, building, or similar platform and range from 502-feet to 289-feet. In contrast, New York's Statue of Liberty is 305-feet tall. The statues are in parks, protected areas, and often in close proximity to prominent temples. Constructed in concrete, steel, and bronze, as well as coated in gold, diamonds, and precious jewels, they are popular tourist attractions, drawing thousands of visitors each year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-grand-buddha-lingshan-jiangsu-province-china>10. The Grand Buddha, Lingshan, Jiangsu Province, China</h2><p>Completed in 1996 as part of the 74-acre Taihu Lake National Tourist Resort and the Lingshan Buddhist Scenic Spot, the Grand Buddha in China's Jiangsu province is an impressive 289 feet tall. The beautiful Buddha is located on the Majishan Peninsula where he stands tall on China's Lingshan Mountain, with Small Mt. Lingshan in the background. The 1,000-year old Tang Dynasty's Xaingfu Temple is a short distance from popular Chinese statue. Weighing more than 725 tons, architects of the attraction used 2,000 bronze sheets to construct region's good luck piece. Reaching the Grand Buddha requires a workout. Visitors must climb the "Ascending Cloud Avenue," a series of seven platforms with 216 steps. The steps represent 108 troubles and 108 wishes. At the end of the stairs is the base of the statue, which stands on a pedestal. Inside the pedestal is a three-floor museum to add to the visitor's workout. However, that's not all in vein; an elevator awaits those to the finish line to the top of the pedestal, where riders can touch the feet of the statue for good luck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=dai-kannon-at-kita-no-miyakopark-ashibetsu-hokkaido-japan>9.

Inside the temperature is cool, which is great for anyone tackling the journey to the top floor using the stairs instead of the elevator. Upon entering the great Kannon, there is a row of 33 small statues representing the 33 incarnations of the Kannon. Across from these statues is a set of 12 statues that depict the 12 symbols in Chinese Astrology. The elevator goes to the observatory, which provides a prayer area and windows to a view like no other-with blue skies, visitors can see all the way to the Pacific Ocean. On the way out, take the stairs, the stairway showcases 108 more Buddhist statues, these representing human desires, both good and bad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=emperors-yan-and-huang-statue-china>5.
