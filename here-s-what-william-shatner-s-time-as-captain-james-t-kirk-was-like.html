His role as this Starship USS Enterprise captain made </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Trek t</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>he most iconic sci-fi TV series of all time. In three seasons, an animated spin-off and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seven Star Trek movies, </a>Shatner&nbsp;gave performances that have often been mimicked...but never duplicated.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Shatner has enjoyed speaking of his experiences over the years, including his memories of the TV series. He credits Kirk for changing his life and making him a megastar. Yet Shatner has often felt “trapped” by how Kirk has become such a huge part of his public persona.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It’s fun to read about the many tales Shatner has told about his time as Kirk, from on-set frivolity to darker moments.

In his memoirs, Shatner acknowledges he just wasn’t prepared to direct a big-screen film, and the constant script rewrites and budget cuts didn’t help.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Shatner feels he “compromised” himself by adjusting the story too much, and had he allowed someone else to direct, it would have made for a better movie.
