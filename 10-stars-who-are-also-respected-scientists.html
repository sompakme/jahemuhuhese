And one iconic Hollywood starlet laid the foundation for the way we live our lives in the 21st century with her inventions.</p><h2 id=natalie-portman><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Natalie Portman</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Portman received a degree in psychology from Harvard in 2003. She was conducting her studies while still filming the Star Wars prequels. She has coauthored not one, but two pieces and one was published before she had finished her time at Harvard. Also, her first piece was based on work she had begun in high school. Her first paper made the case that biodegradable waste can be used to generate energy, and her second piece talked about the activation of the frontal lobe as the brain registers object permanence.</p><h2 id=lisa-kudrow><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lisa Kudrow</span></h2><p>Although she is famous for playing Phoebe Buffay, the airhead hippie on Friends, in real life Lisa Kudrow is an accomplished biologist. She graduated with a degree in biology from Vassar College and is a qualified physician specializing in the treatment of headaches. Kudrow coauthored a psychology paper titled <a href=#>"Handedness and Headache"</a> in 1991, three years before she got her role on Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of Friends Did Some Weird Roles Before Getting Famous</a></span></p><h2 id=ken-jeong><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ken Jeong</span></h2><p>Jeong is a fully qualified medical doctor, most people are aware of that by now as the actor has mentioned it in several interviews. Coincidentally, it was his role as the doctor in Knocked Up that launched his career. However, they might not be aware that he has more than medical degrees. Jeong also has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bachelor's degree in Zoology</a>. He received his medical degrees from Duke University and the University of North Carolina.</p><h2 id=terri-hatcher><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Terri Hatcher</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Desperate Housewives star comes from a very scientific family. Her mother was a computer programmer and her father a nuclear physicist. It is no surprise then that the actress decided to get a degree in mathematics and engineering, both from De Anza college.</p><h2 id=mayim-bialik><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mayim Bialik</span></h2><p>Bialik does not just play a neuroscientist on The Big Bang Theory, she is one in real life. Bialik graduated with a Ph.D. from UCLA in 2007. Her graduate thesis was titled "Hypothalamic regulation in relation to maladaptive, obsessive-compulsive, affiliative, and satiety behaviors in Prader-Willi syndrome." One can't help but wonder if she ever gave the Big Bang writers notes to make sure their science jokes were accurate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brian-may><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Brian May</span></h2><p>In the hit Queen song "Bohemian Rhapsody," we hear Freddie Mercury belt "Galileo Galileo!" in homage to the renaissance astrophysicist. Well, that reference might have had a deeper meaning than the people who sing this song at karaoke night realize. Queen's guitarist Brian May is indeed an astrophysicist. His studies began in 1970, but he put his scientific career aside to focus on music. <a href=#>He returned to his studies several decades later</a> and published his Ph.D. thesis "A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud" in 2007.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-mckellar><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Danica Mckellar</span></h2><p>The star of the 1980s comedy-drama The Wonder Years slowed down her acting to focus on a STEM career. She has authored several books encouraging young girls to get into STEM and graduated from UCLA in 1998 where she also published her thesis "Percolation and Gibbs states multiplicity for ferromagnetic Ashkin–Teller models" whatever those are. She also continues to act and is in shows like Young Justice and How I Met Your Mother. She also once competed on Dancing With The Stars.﻿</p><h2 id=art-garfunkel><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Art Garfunkel</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The other half of the folk duo Simon and Garfunkel could have had a much different career had he gone with his original plan to become a teacher. Garfunkel has a master’s degree in mathematics from Columbia University. He did briefly teach math at a prep school in Connecticut in 1971 but left to focus on music and occasionally acting.</p><h2 id=dolph-lundgren><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Dolph Lundgren</span></h2><p>Lundgren looks more like the guy who would bully scientists than he does an academic, but it just goes to show people should not judge someone on appearance. The muscle-bound actor from Aquaman and Rocky IV got a degree in chemical engineering from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology and a master's degree from the University of Sydney in 1982.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Stars Came Out In Defense Of Amber Heard</a></span></p><h2 id=hedy-lamarr><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Hedy Lamarr</span></h2><p>Lamarr was one of the most iconic stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The sultry star was much more than a pretty face though. Lamarr is responsible for several patents in wireless and radio technology that would eventually become the foundation for WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth communication systems. This iconic star quite literally laid the foundation for the technology of the 21st century, yet most just remember her as a pretty actress from Austria.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> A Scientist Named A Unique Millipede After Taylor Swift</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWjqa6zv4ywn6hlkaeybq3LrKZmqpWovaav056bZquTnrKvwMisq6xn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-stars-who-are-also-respected-scientists.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-stars-who-are-also-respected-scientists.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-stars-who-are-also-respected-scientists.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-stars-who-are-also-respected-scientists.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-stars-who-are-also-respected-scientists.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-stars-who-are-also-respected-scientists.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./8-non-binary-celebrities.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./8-non-binary-celebrities.html>8 Non-Binary Celebrities</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-expensive-weekend-bags-for-men.html>10 Expensive Weekend Bags For Men</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-expensive-weekend-bags-for-men.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
