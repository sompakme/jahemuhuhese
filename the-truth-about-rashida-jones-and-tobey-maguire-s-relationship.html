For that reason, at times it can be very difficult to keep track of who is dating who in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, some stars seem to be most interested in finding lasting relationships. Even still, there are many examples of celebrities who dated one another for a long time yet almost everyone seems to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">forgotten they ever were a couple</a>.</p><p>If you are looking for an example of a celebrity couple from the past that nobody seems to talk about these days, then you only need to look at Rashida Jones and Tobey Maguire. However, unlike some celebrity couples that seem to have been completely forgotten about, most people never knew that Tobey and Rashida ever were a couple in the first place.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Couples You Forgot Dated In The '80s</a></span></p><h2 id=impressive-careers>Impressive Careers</h2><p>At one time, Tobey Maguire was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Best known as the star of the original Spider-Man movie trilogy, before Tom Holland brought the web crawler to life in the MCU, an entire generation of fans loved Maguire’s take on the character. In addition to his most famous film series, Maguire starred in many other memorable movies including Pleasantville and Seabiscuit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the first two seasons of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Office</a>, the show’s legions of fans were desperate to see Pam and Jim become a couple. With that in mind, when Rashida Jones was hired to play a new love interest for Jim, it seemed likely that the show’s most avid fans would detest her character. However, Rashida is such a charming actor that some fans of The Office decided they wanted to see Jim wind up with her character instead. Since leaving The Office behind, Rashida has been excellent in several other roles. If that wasn’t impressive enough, Rashida has proven how dedicated and intelligent she is behind the scenes as a successful producer, director, and writer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tobey Maguire And Andrew Garfield Rumored To Appear In Spider-Man 3, Fans Are Losing It On Social Media</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=other-romances>Other Romances</h2><p>While Tobey Maguire and Rashida Jones ultimately didn’t make things work as a couple, that doesn’t mean that they haven’t been able to find love elsewhere. In the case of Tobey Maguire, he would go on to meet a jewelry designer named Jennifer Meyer in 2003 and they hit things off. After the pair became a couple, they got engaged in April 2006, welcomed their daughter into the world in November 2006, got married in 2007, and had their son in 2009. Unfortunately, nine years after Maguire and Meyer walked down the aisle, they separated in 2016. Seemingly not completely willing to give up on their marriage at that time, it wasn’t until late-2020 that Meyer would file for divorce from Maguire.</p><p>When it comes to Rashida Jones, in 2003 she got engaged to the music producer Mark Ronson but they split around a year later. Over the next decade and a half, very little was known about Jones’ dating life. Then, in 2018, Jones shocked her fans by revealing that she had been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating the musician Ezra Koenig for years</a> at that time. If that wasn’t a big enough surprise already, Jones had kept it a secret that she had been carrying Koenig’s baby and the couple welcomed their son into the world in August 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Blake Lively And Penn Badgley Kept Their Relationship A Secret</a></span></p><h2 id=blast-from-the-past>Blast From The Past</h2><p>Given the fact that the masses have completely forgotten that Rashida Jones and Tobey Maguire ever were a couple, you may assume their relationship was a flash in the pan. Amazingly enough, however, the exact opposite is true since they were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">together from 1997 until 2000</a> and according to some reports, they were engaged at one point. To make things clear, it is far from confirmed that Jones and Maguire ever were engaged as neither of them has addressed those reports. That said, the fact that they were together for roughly three years points to how serious their relationship was.</p><p>On the one hand, it makes some sense that people are unaware that Rashida Jones and Tobey Maguire dated. After all, when Rashida was dating Tobey she wasn’t famous yet and the press seemed to be more interested in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maguire’s friendship with Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. However, Rashida has gone on to be among the most likable stars in Hollywood so you’d think people would look into her romantic past more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Rashida Jones wasn’t famous when she dated Tobey Maguire, his career was absolutely on fire during their relationship. After all, in between the years 1997 and 2000, several popular movies that starred Maguire were released including Pleasantville, The Cider House Rules, and Wonder Boys among others. With that in mind, it is abundantly clear that Maguire was on his way to becoming internationally famous so it seems odd that people didn’t pay attention to his girlfriend at the time. After all, Rashida is the daughter of the legendary record producer Quincy Jones.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's A Look At Leonardo DiCaprio & Tobey Maguire’s Friendship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6s63SoaCdmV2fvK%2Bx0maYp5xdqbyjsdhmpJqfpZ6%2Fpr%2BMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-rashida-jones-and-tobey-maguire-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-truth-about-rashida-jones-and-tobey-maguire-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-rashida-jones-and-tobey-maguire-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-truth-about-rashida-jones-and-tobey-maguire-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-rashida-jones-and-tobey-maguire-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-rashida-jones-and-tobey-maguire-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wwe-wanted-released-star-to-manage-omos-but-they-declined.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wwe-wanted-released-star-to-manage-omos-but-they-declined.html>WWE Wanted Released Star To Manage Omos But They Declined</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nadine-milad-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Nadine Milad Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nadine-milad-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
