Since <a href=#>missile attack is deadly and frightening</a>, the people are looking for refuge. At the time, Russia positioned Russian nuclear rockets less than 100 miles from the coast of Florida, and they were ready to launch toward the United States. These has been recorded as <a href=#>one of the most expensive missiles in the world</a>. Countries constructed shelters for a possible missile assault in the backyards or basements of thousands of homes, but the threat never materialized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the years passed and the possibility of an atomic bomb war receded into the distance, the majority of the bomb shelters were converted into playrooms, utilized as food storage, or just left abandoned. Now, people are scrambling once more to find the best and safest area to ride out the current crisis, which is yet another disaster that has occurred recently. The price of one of the most magnificent doomsday bunkers, located in Las Vegas and erected in 1978 by Avon cosmetics executive Jerry Henderson, has increased from $1.7 million in 2014 to a coronavirus-brain-busting $18 million in 2020. Take a look inside the $18 million underground mansion.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="These Are 10 Most Expensive Hotels In Las Vegas, As Of 2022" href=#>These Are 10 Most Expensive Hotels In Las Vegas, As Of 2022</a></span></p><h2 id=a-mansion-for-hacking-the-apocalypse>A Mansion For Hacking The Apocalypse</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The house is a one-of-a-kind attraction and has gained considerable notoriety throughout the years. In addition to a swimming pool, it features five bedrooms, six bathrooms, and a little guesthouse elevated above the ground. It was constructed in 1978 to serve as a bomb shelter; nevertheless, it is not safe from the effects of a nuclear catastrophe. Previous owners have improved the house by putting in several contemporary furnishings and making several other enhancements that make it easier for new owners to live there.</p><p>The area is decked with imitation rocks, hand-painted murals depicting realistic landscapes, and artificial trees for further realism. You can alter the lighting below ground to simulate the sun at various times during the day, and pulsating stars are painted on the ceiling to make it appear as though you are in the middle of the night. Although it is not as great as<a href=#> the most expensive paintings of Monet</a>, it still serves its purpose. Even though Las Vegas is packed with things to see and do, this one, situated only around four kilometers from the Strip, would undoubtedly be one of a kind. The estate is said to feature two Jacuzzis, a sauna, a nightclub with a bar and dance floor, and even a guest house, according to a claim published in Forbes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Below ground, the residence has cellular phone reception, cable, and internet access. According to the study, recent work included replacing air-conditioning systems in addition to other infrastructure modifications. This underground home is ideal for hosting parties and other gatherings due to its realistic environment, which features hand-painted murals depicting views from the several residences that the original owner of the home owned all over the World. It also features fake trees and rocks. In addition to a bar, a pool, two hot tubs, a sauna, and a putting green with four holes, a guest house is available for guests who choose to spend the night. The home has a central air conditioning system, a water tank that holds one thousand gallons, underground cable and internet connections, and cellular phone connectivity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=building-the-bunker-underground>Building The Bunker Underground</h2><p>Even though the I-beams and other underground features are more difficult to depict in photographs than the house's interior, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Realtor Stephan LaForge</a> believes that the vast underground property is the primary selling point of the listing. According to what LaForge said to Realtor.com, the price reflects that it is impossible to build a structure like this one today. The most recent sale of it was in 2014 for $1.15 million. This underground mansion in Las Vegas, a city that is the <a href=#>center of the biggest entertainment hubs in the world</a>, was constructed in 1979 by Jerry Henderson, a successful businessman and philanthropist who served as a former member and founder of Avon Cosmetics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home reflects the period in which it was built. Henderson, a pioneer in underground living, made sure that the property had every luxury required, including a dance floor, pool, BBQ, and five or six bathrooms. When he passed away in 1983, his wife, Mary, built a townhouse on the surface for themselves because she was not a big fan of living beneath. When Jerry passed away, Mary moved upstairs into the townhouse she built above the bunker. She remained there until she died in 1989 when both properties were repossessed. Mary created the townhouse after Jerry passed away.</p><p>The Society made several improvements to the facility after purchasing the bunker in 2014 for $1.15 million and subsequently making the purchase. The bomb shelter is 15,000 square feet and has a pool, jacuzzi, casita, putting green, 500 feet of landscape murals, and time-of-day lighting settings to simulate the World outside. One can take an elevator down from a higher structure to reach it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-owners-of-the-mansion-and-how-it-got-famous>The Owners Of The Mansion And How It Got Famous</h2><p>In 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Voelker</a>, president of the Society for the Preservation of Near Extinct Species (SPNES), bought the house for $1.15 million. Voelker was also the one who told the media about the underground mansion, which immediately got attraction. The property has five bedrooms and six bathrooms and is part of a 15,200-square-foot basement with its casita. It was built underground, it is a traditional townhouse although it is not as popular as <a href=#>the NYC Townhouse of Ethan Hawke</a>, it is equipped with two stories, and contains a casita on its own. The bombproof escape house intends to provide its owners with a source of entertainment if they become isolated from the rest of humanity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to a nightclub with a bar and dance floor, there is also a putting green, a swimming pool, two Jacuzzis, a sauna, and an outside section that is decorated with enormous murals depicting scenes from the countryside and the forest. An entrance that is disguised by rocks and comes equipped with an elevator will take you to the depths of the underground home. A stairway is also concealed in a shed in the rear. Although the property was not purpose-built to resist the force of a nuclear explosion, it is situated 26 feet below the ground. It has the potential to be redesigned and transformed into a genuine nuclear bunker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The listing states that the house is equipped with repeaters that make it possible to receive cellular service, cable, and internet belowground.
