And with Season 24 bringing back coaches like Gwen Stefani and John Legend who have been on the show for several seasons, Niall Horan who won last season, and newcomer, Reba McEntire, the competition will be fierce and the paydays will be high for these coaches with huge audience appeal.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Ariana Grande</span></h2><h3 id=salary-on-the-voice-20--25-million>Salary On The Voice: $20-$25 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar47106858-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Season(s) On The Voice: Season 21</strong></li></ul><p><a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> is one of the most popular performers on the face of the planet, and she stole headlines when it was revealed that she was going to be making between $20-25 million while being featured on The Voice.
