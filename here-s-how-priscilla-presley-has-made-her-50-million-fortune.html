She was married to Elvis Presley for six years, gave birth to their only daughter, Lisa Marie and was the symbol of Hollywood’s elite for some time, however, Presley has earned a career and a net worth of $50 million using her business savvy, likeable personality and a passion for her family.</p><p>Born in Brooklyn and after losing her father in a plane crash at just six months old, no one could have known <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">the star-studded path</a> in which the actress would embark upon at the young age of 14, but she’s made a name for herself over the years in a variety of pursuits, despite loss and separation.</p><p>Presley’s life has been plagued by the untimely death of loved ones, including Elvis in 1976, her grandson Benjamin Keough in 2020, her mother in 2021 and daughter, Lisa Marie in 2023 at the age of 54.</p><p>Check out the many ways Priscilla Presley has earned her millions – and it’s not just due to her famous marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marriage-and-family>Marriage And Family</h2><p>Of course, marrying <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The King</a> didn’t hurt matters. Presley was living with her parents in Germany in 1956, where she met Elvis when she was just 14 years old. Shortly after, Presley moved to Memphis, TN, agreeing to finish school, moved in with the music icon and the pair married on May 1, 1967. They became parents to Lisa Marie on Feb. 1, 1968.</p><p>Though the Presley’s separated and officially divorced in the fall of 1973, they remained close and continued to co-parent Lisa Marie. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, in the divorce settlement Presley received $725,000 in cash payment, child support, spousal support, 50 percent of the proceeds from the sale of their Beverly Hills home and five percent of the royalties from Elvis’ publishing companies.</p><h2 id=hollywood-calls>Hollywood Calls</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One might think Presley was set for life with no need to look for additional income, however, Priscilla was full of ambition and continued to search for opportunities to showcase her talent. If fans didn’t know her already, Presley starred in the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">popular series</a> Dallas from 1983 to 1988 and appeared in all three The Naked Gun films alongside Leslie Nielsen. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Money Inc.</a>, other acting credits include Touched by an Angel, Melrose Place and Spin City.</p><h2 id=keeping-the-legacy-alive>Keeping The Legacy Alive</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Elvis passed away of a heart attack in 1976, everything he owned was willed to Lisa Marie, just nine years old at the time. Presley became executor for Lisa Marie and could quickly see the financial straights her daughter would soon manage. In 1982, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world opened to the public. <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Graceland mansion</a> tour and additional property attracts more than 650,000 visitors each year. The company Presley created, Elvis Presley Enterprises ensured the estate was worth more than $100 million by the time Lisa Marie was old enough to inherit it in 1993.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;'The King' Of The Screen: 10 Highest-Grossing Elvis Presley Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=business-ventures>Business Ventures</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Upon separating from her husband, Presley opened Bis & Beau in Los Angeles.

For fans, perhaps the detail <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Presley shares about her husband</a> drew them in, as audiences got to know the couple a little better.</p><h2 id=real-estate>Real Estate</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after the couple’s divorce, Presley purchased a 7,000 square foot home in Beverly Hills, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">close to Elvis’ home</a> in the same area. She also bought her parents a home in Los Angeles for $170,000. In 2019, Presley sold her parents home for $3.9 million and sold her own home a year later for $13 million. Today, the 77-year-old star lives in a Century City, CA penthouse she purchased for just under $5 million.</p><h2 id=behind-the-camera>Behind The Camera</h2><p>Presley has produced several films and television projects: many of which center around the “Hound Dog” singer.
