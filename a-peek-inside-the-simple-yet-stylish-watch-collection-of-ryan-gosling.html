He may be extremely well-known and have a stunning family as he married Eva Mendes although there was a time when <a href=#>he took a break from acting</a>. However, he still has some of the boy-next-door, everyman charms of earlier leading men, increasing his attraction to his adoring following.</p><p>His specialty is portraying all-American heroes, such as the Lothario with a golden heart in Crazy, Stupid, Love, a jazz pianist with enormous goals in La La Land, an all-dancing, all-singing jazz pianist in First Man, and astronaut Neil Armstrong. Ryan Gosling portrays Sierra Six in the movie The Gray Man, one such assassin. When his appointed task goes awry, he disappears, with Chris Evans's villainous killer Lloyd Hansen chasing after him. Gosling prefers basic, iconic timepieces when it comes to them. He wears a variety of watches, including this one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="8 Ways Ryan Gosling Earns And Spends His Millions" href=#>8 Ways Ryan Gosling Earns And Spends His Millions</a></span></p><h2 id=rolex-air-king-5500>Rolex Air King 5500</h2><p>He accepted his 2017 Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy while sporting a 1950s Rolex Air King 5500. With its off-white face, original riveted bracelet, and wonderfully proportioned 34mm case, this watch has the same broad appeal as a worn-in pair of Levi's 501s or a clean, white button-down shirt. It would look great on anyone's wrist. Gosling is renowned for keeping things simple when it comes to style. As traditional and understated as evening dress can be, he wore his Rolex Air King with a white dinner jacket, a crimson carnation, and a loosely tied velvet bow tie.</p><h2 id=patek-philippe-5196g>Patek Philippe 5196G</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gosling wore various watches while appearing in the movie Drive, but one vintage</p><p>from one of the <a href=#>most renowned watch manufacturers in the world</a>, Patek Phillipe stuck out the most. The classic white watch face looks stunning next to the traditional black&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; crocodile wristband. Ryan asked to use this watch in the movie, rumored to have been a Gosling family heirloom. With baton indexes, dauphine hands, sub-seconds at 6'oclock, tapering lugs, and a covert crown without guards, the Patek Philippe Calatrava 5196G has it all. Each component plays excellent homage to the original. Still, Patek made the sensible decision to modernize the 5196 with a modern 7mm frame and leave the 31mm original case to history aficionados.</p><h2 id=rolex-submariner-ref-16610>Rolex Submariner Ref 16610</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moving on, Ryan Gosling is fond of old Rolexes, as seen in Crazy, Stupid, Love. He was named Jacob in the film, and he plays a smooth-talking seducer. In earlier scenes, he is seen sporting a more substantial modern Rolex Submariner reference 16610, which we believe is from the 2000s. The Rolex Submariner 16610 was first created in 1988, powered by the automatic Rolex caliber 3135, the brand's oldest-serving movement, where the date at the 3 o'clock position. The watch had its original black glossy faces with T25 tritium hour markers and hands.</p><h2 id=rolex-3372>Rolex 3372</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another timepiece the&nbsp;<a href=#>Crazy, Stupid, Love actor</a>&nbsp;wore was a yellow gold bubble backreference 3372 with a brown leather strap that is thought to be from the 1940s. Fantastic and incredibly rare ROLEX Ref 3372 Bubble back Automatic from the 1940s in a stunning Full set (box and all papers!) in top original and untouched condition. Fantastic silver cream dial with gorgeous patina in perfect condition, beautiful roman gold numerals, and gold hands with great patina. Excellent and substantial 32 mm screw-back case made of unpolished stainless steel. The watch's movement is in perfect shape, it keeps the time, and there is no repair history or servicing components; everything is original.</p><h2 id=omega-speed-master-105-012>Omega Speed Master 105.012</h2><p>The Omega Speed master 105.012 that Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong famously wore while aboard Apollo 11 is necessary for the film to be complete. The clock has since become known as the Moon Watch. Some of the attire worn by the cast was made from accurate models from the Omega archives. In the 2016 romantic musical movie La La Land, Ryan Gosling's clothing was obviously influenced by the 1940s and 1950s. He always wears a plain 1950s gold Omega watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jaeger-lecoultre-master-memovox>Jaeger LeCoultre Master Memovox</h2><p>The actor was also spotted wearing the first automatic alarm watch named Jaeger LeCoultre Master Memovox. <a href=#>Canadian actor Ryan Gosling</a> love the mechanical alarm, clean clock, and precisely spherical shell. His collection reveals his ardent love of understatement and old components. This model is a Memovox, and it is current and dated 2014. Ryan Gosling favors plain, straightforward watches. This modestly sized, reasonably priced automatic watch has clear daily wear potential but leans more toward the formal. The cornerstones of a substantial watch collection can include wristwatches with classic styling and excellent quality.</p><h2 id=rolex-vintage-oyster-perpetual>Rolex Vintage Oyster Perpetual</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gosling wore a 1940s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolex Vintage Oyster Perpetual</a> in the 2011 romantic movie Crazy, Stupid, Love. The entire construction of the bubble-back watch was made of yellow gold. In the 1920s, the renowned Swiss bracelet manufacturer Gay Freres supplied metal bracelets for Rolex watches. Since other watch manufacturers were also using these bracelets, Rolex decided to create their own, giving rise to the Oyster. The Oyster is distinguished by its sturdy three-link construction that may accommodate various clasps (Oysterclasp, Oysterlock, and Crownclasp). It may be found on every Professional model in addition to several vintage designs like the Date just, Day-Date, and Sky-Dweller.</p><h2 id=tag-heuer>TAG Heuer</h2><p>Recently, Ryan Gosling's bleach blonde hair, inspired by Barbie, was all the rage on social media. However, the actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sporting a much edgier look </a>and timepiece for a new commercial. Ryan Gosling has teamed up with watchmaker TAG Heuer to promote their Carrera Three Hands timepiece in his upcoming film, The Gray Man. In the action film, which opens in theaters on July 22, Ryan Gosling plays a CIA operative who leaves after learning of a secret plan within the agency. The film, based on a Mark Greaney book, stars Chris Evans, Regé-Jean Page, and Ana de Armas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Net Worth Of The Cast Of 'The Gray Man', Ranked" href=#>The Net Worth Of The Cast Of 'The Gray Man', Ranked</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Code List</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiss Watch Expo</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hodinkee</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Bmp56dm2K2r7%2FInZxmrJiaerS1zKmjnmWpmsFuv9Oyo6KrmGLEosDCoWScp5yhsqTAyKilZqeWYr%2B6rc1mnqirnJ67qHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-peek-inside-the-simple-yet-stylish-watch-collection-of-ryan-gosling.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fa-peek-inside-the-simple-yet-stylish-watch-collection-of-ryan-gosling.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-simple-yet-stylish-watch-collection-of-ryan-gosling.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fa-peek-inside-the-simple-yet-stylish-watch-collection-of-ryan-gosling.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-simple-yet-stylish-watch-collection-of-ryan-gosling.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-inside-the-simple-yet-stylish-watch-collection-of-ryan-gosling.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./andreina-fabbi-age-wikipedia-learn-more-about-roberto-baggio-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./andreina-fabbi-age-wikipedia-learn-more-about-roberto-baggio-wife.html>Andreina Fabbi Age Wikipedia: Learn More About Roberto Baggio Wife</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-lisa-marie-presley-s-four-marriages.html>What Happened To Lisa Marie Presley's Four Marriages?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-to-lisa-marie-presley-s-four-marriages.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
