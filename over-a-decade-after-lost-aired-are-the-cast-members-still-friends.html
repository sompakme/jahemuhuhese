<time>05 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Long before Manifest, there was Lost, which some may refer to as the OG mystery plane series. One of the geniuses who came up with this show was none other than J.J. Abrams (the same guy behind Jennifer Garner’s breakout show, Alias) who somehow managed to put together the ABC series in just several weeks <a href=#>after hearing about a canceled Conan O’Brien reality show</a> of the same title.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout its run, Lost went on to win 51 Emmy nods and 10 wins. Meanwhile, several of its cast members also went on to become some of Hollywood’s biggest stars. After all this time though, are they all still in touch?</p><h2 id=who-are-the-stars-of-lost>Who Are The Stars Of Lost?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lost-abc.png><p>Unlike in other shows, Abrams and fellow creators Jeffrey Lieber and Damon Lindelof started casting for Lost while <a href=#>they were still writing it</a>. That meant things were changing all the time, and everyone had to adapt on the fly.</p><p>Eventually, however, they managed to finalize the characters and rounded up their cast just within days before they started production.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For starters, there was Matthew Fox who landed the role of Jack (although Jon Hamm also read for the part, but he went on to do Mad Men). He was also soon joined by Josh Holloway and Evangeline Lilly who barely had any acting experience at that time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 'Lost' Casting Decisions That Ruined The Show (& 7 That Saved It)</a></span></p><p>They reached out to Dominic Monaghan just one day after Return of the King won big at the Oscars. Abrams also cast Jorge Garcia after seeing him play a drug dealer on Curb Your Enthusiasm. And while the characters Sun and Jin were supposed to be an older Japanese couple, the creators also decided to make the characters Korean and younger the moment Daniel Dae-Kim read for the part.</p><p>Aside from these stars, the show also went on to cast Terry O’Quinn (the veteran actor didn’t need much convincing to shoot a series in Hawaii), Yunjin Kim, Emilie De Ravin, Naveen Andrews, Harold Perrineau, Malcolm David Kelley, Michael Emerson, and Maggie Grace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the later seasons, they were also joined by Henry Ian Cusick, Ken Leung, Elizabeth Mitchell, Ian Somerhalder, and Nestor Carbonell.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-the-cast-after-lost-ended>What Happened To The Cast After Lost Ended?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/paul-rudd-kathryn-newton-in-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-via-youtube-marvel-entertainment-channel.jpg><p>The show’s success certainly helped set a lot of the Lost stars up for further stardom. For instance, Lilly went on to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe after landing the iconic role of Hope Van Dyne.</p><p>Grace went on star alongside Liam Neeson <a href=#>in the Taken franchise and has since done other films</a> too. As for Perrineau, he also delved into films, starring in 28 Weeks Later and Dumplin’. More recently, he also joined Nathan Fillion in The Rookie.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's The Truth About 'Lost's' Controversial Series Finale</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, several Lost stars continued to do mostly television work. These include Garcia, O’Quinn, and Cusick. Notably, Somerhalder went on to become one of the stars of Vampire Diaries.</p><p>Holloway ended up starring in shows such as Intelligence, Colony, and Yellowstone, although, he also joined Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol. Similarly, Andrews went on to star in various TV shows such as Sense8, The Cleaning Lady, and more recently, The Dropout with Amanda Seyfried.</p><p>As for Fox, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">retired from acting</a> for some time, but he has agreed to roles in recent years.</p><h2 id=are-the-lost-cast-members-still-friends-today>Are The Lost Cast Members Still Friends Today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maggie-grace-and-ian-somerhalder-attending-the-lost-10-year-anniversary-at-the-31st-paleyfest.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Lost cast members haven’t had many chances to work together again since the show, they’ve certainly remained in touch over the years. Not only that but they also meet up whenever possible.</p><p>Back in 2014, they even reunited to celebrate the show’s 10th anniversary at PaleyFest. Onstage, fans were delighted to see Holloway, Grace, Kim, Garcia, Cusick, and Somerhalder together as they talked about their time on the show.</p><p>More recently, Kim, Perrineau, and Holloway also got together back in December during the holiday season as shown by their Instagram photos. As it turns out, the meet-up is more of a regular occurrence for the three men as Perrineau <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained to People</a> in February 2022 as he referred to their group as the “three amigos.”</p><p>The actor also revealed that their families are also quite close. “Our kids grew up knowing each other,” Perrineau said. And so, they would all catch up “once in a while.” At the same time, Perrineau also revealed that he also remains in touch with Somerhalder, Monaghan, and Andrews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What 'Lost' Star Naveen Andrews Is Up To Now</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Kim also celebrated the 2022 Fourth of July weekend with some of his former co-stars. In a series of Instagram photos, the actor was pictured hanging out with Holloway and Cusick. On the other hand, it’s unclear if Lilly and Monaghan had remained in touch since their split in 2007.</p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speaking on Anna Faris’ Unqualified podcast</a>, the Lord of the Rings star revealed that they broke up after learning that Lilly started seeing someone else while they were still together.</p><p>As much of the cast remains good friends to this day, fans can almost count on Holloway, Kim, Perrineau, and Cusick getting together again quite soon. Given that the cast reconnected for the show's 10th anniversary, it can only be assumed that they will continue the trend for future anniversaries, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dqbWmecuoqq1lk5bAtXnMnqSbnaKoerTAyKWjZp6inrKvsNJo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fover-a-decade-after-lost-aired-are-the-cast-members-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fover-a-decade-after-lost-aired-are-the-cast-members-still-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fover-a-decade-after-lost-aired-are-the-cast-members-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fover-a-decade-after-lost-aired-are-the-cast-members-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fover-a-decade-after-lost-aired-are-the-cast-members-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fover-a-decade-after-lost-aired-are-the-cast-members-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rasheeda-frost-net-worth-how-much-is-frost-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rasheeda-frost-net-worth-how-much-is-frost-worth.html>Rasheeda Frost Net Worth How Much is Frost Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mark-capps-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Mark Capps Obituary: What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mark-capps-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
