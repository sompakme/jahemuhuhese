His evolution happened through different storylines: from experiencing fatherhood to reflecting on systemic racism following the death of George Floyd in 2020.</p><p>After four fulfilling seasons as Dean, Onaodowan decided it was time he pursued other career opportunities. According to several sources, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor approached the creative team</a>, including Station 19 and Grey's Anatomy showrunner Krista Vernoff and executive producer Paris Barclay, to ask them to write his character off (via Deadline).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Could Katherine Heigl Return To 'Grey's Anatomy'?</a></span></p><p>Onaodowan agreed to star in the first few episodes of season five, which premiered in September 2021, to wrap up Dean's story.</p><h2 id=dean-miller-dies-during-a-crossover-event-with-grey-39-s-anatomy>Dean Miller Dies During A Crossover Event With Grey's Anatomy</h2><p>In episode five "Things We Lost In The Fire" (which marked the beginning of a crossover event with Grey's Anatomy), Dean dies of the injuries sustained during a gas explosion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier in the episode, the character responds to a call with Vic Hughes (Barrett Doss) and the rest of the group. While on site, he and Vic are both injured and transported to the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.</p><p>Vic's ambulance arrives first, while Dean's followed with its sirens turned off, meaning that the patient on board has died. Dean passes away after sharing a touching moment with Ben Warren (Jason George).</p><p>After Dean's death, Ben recalled a promise he had made his friend: he had agreed to take care of his daughter Pruitt if anything happened to him. Though hesitant, Ben's wife, Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), agrees to take Pruitt in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dean-miller-and-other-characters-who-were-written-off-shondaland-shows>Dean Miller And Other Characters Who Were Written Off Shondaland Shows</h2><p>While Dean's death shouldn't come as a surprise for many seasoned Shondaland shows watchers, the dynamics of Onaodowan's exit are a little unusual as he was killed off after specifically requesting to leave.</p><p>Many other actors have left Shondaland shows to pursue more work opportunities. While some of them have seen their characters die just like Onaodowan did — it happened to Grey's Anatomy's Cheryl Leigh (Lexie Grey) and T.R. Knight (George O'Malley) others, including Bridgerton star Regé-Jean Page (Simon Basset) and <a href=#>Grey's veteran Sara Ramirez</a> (Callie Torres) and Sandra Oh (Cristina Yang), were simply written off without kicking the bucket.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other actors, however, were let go due to storyline reasons, including Jessica Capshaw and <a href=#>Sarah Drew on Grey's</a>, without having a say in their characters' fates, but leaving the door open for a possible return.</p><p>In a show which has seen relatively fewer deaths among the main cast compared to other Shondaland series, it was probably the right decision for Station 19 to have such a tear-jerking exit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Leaving Grey’s Anatomy Was A Good Decision For Sandra Oh</a></span></p><p>"It's been a pleasure being Dean. I have Shonda Rhimes, Stacy McKee, Krista Vernoff, Paris Barclay, and ABC to thank for allowing me to bring him to life," the actor said in a statement to Deadline in November last year.</p><p>"I am grateful I got to work with the most loving, kind, and dedicated crew in network TV. And most importantly, thanks to the fans for showing Dean so much love. I hope he has inspired you to change your world for the better.
