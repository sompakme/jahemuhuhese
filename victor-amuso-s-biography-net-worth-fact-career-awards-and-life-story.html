He was described as a “Deadly Don” by Assistant United States Attorney Charles Rose. Amuso’s reign is considered one of the bloodiest periods in American Mafia history during the late 1980s and early 1990s, alongside his former underboss and close protégé Anthony Casso, who turned informer against him in 1994. Since the death of Colombo crime family boss Carmine Persico in March 2019, Amuso is currently the longest-serving crime family boss of the Five Families and American Mafia, dating back to 1987. Amuso has been serving a life sentence since 1992 and is currently allocated at the Federal Correctional Institution, Cumberland, in Maryland, on murder and racketeering charges.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Early life">Early life</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Enforcer for Gallo">Enforcer for Gallo</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Lucchese crime family">Lucchese crime family</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title=Associate>Associate</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5" href=# title="Made man to prison">Made man to prison</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6" href=# title="Murder of Frank DeCicco">Murder of Frank DeCicco</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7" href=# title="Murder of Anthony Luongo">Murder of Anthony Luongo</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8" href=# title="Boss of the Lucchese family">Boss of the Lucchese family</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-9" href=# title="The Cartel Windows case">The Cartel Windows case</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-10" href=# title="Dispute with Accetturo">Dispute with Accetturo</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-11" href=# title="Fugitives and convictions">Fugitives and convictions</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-12" href=# title="Imprisoned Lucchese Boss">Imprisoned Lucchese Boss</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-13" href=# title="New Lucchese Acting boss">New Lucchese Acting boss</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-14" href=# title="Fearing rivalry from Bronx">Fearing rivalry from Bronx</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-15" href=# title=" Bronx & Brooklyn rivalry">Bronx & Brooklyn rivalry</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-16" href=# title="Restructure of the family">Restructure of the family</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-17" href=# title=" Joe DeFede’s imprisonment">Joe DeFede’s imprisonment</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-18" href=# title=" Wonderboy’s enormous profit">Wonderboy’s enormous profit</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-19" href=# title=" Daidone, DeFede and D’Arco">Daidone, DeFede and D’Arco</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-20" href=# title=" The Committee/Ruling Panel">The Committee/Ruling Panel</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-21" href=# title=" Wonderboy’s return">Wonderboy’s return</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-22" href=# title=" Brooklyn’s DeSantis">Brooklyn’s DeSantis</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vittorio Amuso was born November 4, 1934 and grew up in Canarsie, Brooklyn. In the late 1940s, he was introduced to Anthony “Tony Ducks” Corallo, a prominent <i>caporegime</i> in the Gagliano crime family, a forerunner of the Lucchese crime family. Amuso acted as a bodyguard and chauffeur for Carmine Tramunti.</p><p>Vic Amuso was married to Barbara, and the couple had one daughter, Victoria. They live in Howard Beach, Queens.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=enforcer-for-gallo></span>Enforcer for Gallo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He later became an enforcer for Profaci crime family mobster, Joseph “Crazy Joe” Gallo, in Brooklyn. In the early 1960s, the Gallo brothers declared war against longtime crime boss, Giuseppe “Joe” Profaci and the old Profaci faction of the family, because Profaci cut into Gallo’s profits. Amuso would allegedly kill several members of the Profaci faction, but was sent to prison sometime in the early 1960s, along with Joey Gallo and a dozen others, for extortion charges.</p><p>After Joe Gallo’s release from prison in early 1971, he continued his war against the family on June 28, 1971, when boss Joseph Colombo was shot. Months later on April 7, 1972, Joe Gallo was shot to death in Little Italy Manhattan, New York, while he was celebrating his 43rd birthday. Many Colombo crime family members, especially those from the old Gallo crew, defected to other crime families. Amuso went to the Lucchese family sometime during that year, as an associate in the “19th Hole Crew,” whose capo was Christopher “Christie Tick” Furnari.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lucchese-crime-family></span>Lucchese crime family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=associate></span>Associate<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Amuso became of one of Furnari’s top protégés along with Anthony “Gaspipe” Casso. On December 21, 1972, Amuso was arrested by police outside the “House on Morgan Avenue,” a front for the “Bronx Connection” kickback scheme, selling prison paroles for as high as $20,000 to prison inmates. Presumably to meet with the building owner, Richard Curro, a city corrections officer and Lucchese family associate, who acted as liaison between inmates and the Luccheses, Amuso was in possession of a switchblade and a file folder of parole documents at the time of his arrest.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=made-man-to-prison></span>Made man to prison<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 1977, Amuso became a made man in the Lucchese family. On May 30, 1977, Amuso was arrested with Anthony “Gaspipe” Casso, for their involvement in a drug trafficking ring smuggling heroin from Bangkok, Thailand. At the time of the Brooklyn mobsters’ arrest, he had been found with three pounds of heroin in his possession. Reportedly, the heroin operation was headed by Amuso, his cooperator Casso, and two other associates of the Lucchese crime family. They were all sent to prison.</p><p>Furnari was promoted to <i>consigliere</i> in 1980, and Amuso succeeded him as capo. Furnari actually wanted Casso to succeed him, but Casso preferred to become Furnari’s aide-de-camp; a <i>consigliere</i> is allowed to have one soldier work for him directly.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=murder-of-frank-decicco></span>Murder of Frank DeCicco<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On April 13, 1986, the underboss of the Gambino crime family, Frank DeCicco, was killed when a bomb placed under his car went off. The bomb had been planted by Herbert Pate, while Amuso, Casso, and Vic’s brother Robert watched from a parked car. The target was allegedly Gambino boss John Gotti, who earlier, with DeCicco, had organized the murder of former boss Paul Castellano, without the permission of the Commission. Reportedly, Amuso and Casso, along with Genovese crime family boss Vincent “Chin” Gigante, had planned Gotti’s execution, but killed DeCicco by mistake. Although Casso later testified that both he and Amuso had conspired with Gigante, this was never raised at the trial, because Casso was dropped from the Witness Protection Program many years later.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=murder-of-anthony-luongo></span>Murder of Anthony Luongo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On February 15, 1985, Corallo, Furnari and underboss Salvatore “Tom Mix” Santoro were indicted in the Mafia Commission Trial, along with the top major heads of the Five Families. To replace him, Corallo put his protégé Anthony “Buddy” Luongo as acting boss sometime in early 1986. However, around December of that same year, Luongo disappeared. It was rumored that Amuso, then Luongo’s driver and bodyguard, killed him to remove his last major opponent, with the assistance of Casso.</p><p>By late 1986, Corallo realized that he, Santoro and Furnari were headed for convictions that would send them to prison for life. To avoid internal war and keep up the family’s tradition of a peaceful transfer of power, Corallo summoned Amuso and Casso to a meeting at Furnari’s house, and decided that one of them would succeed him as boss. Furnari then met with his two protègés and told them to decide which one would take the mantle. They ultimately decided that it should be Amuso. He was named acting boss later in 1986, and the new official boss on January 13, 1987, when Corallo and others were sentenced to life imprisonment.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=boss-of-the-lucchese-family></span>Boss of the Lucchese family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-cartel-windows-case></span>The Cartel Windows case<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Amuso, the first member of the Lucchese family’s Brooklyn wing to become boss, soon started one of the bloodiest reigns in Mafia history. Historically, the Lucchese family had been reckoned as the most peaceful of the Five Families. In marked contrast, Amuso had a simple way of dealing with anyone who crossed him—kill them on the spot.</p><p>The bloodletting started with the so-called “Windows Case” in 1986, when Amuso felt that his family wasn’t getting enough profit from the operation, and demanded that Casso supervise Lucchese’s share in the cartel. The Gambino, Colombo, Genovese and Lucchese families had together created a cartel in 1978, which eventually controlled over $150 million in contracts from the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA). The cartel monopolized the industry through Local 580, a Lucchese family-controlled local of the Iron Workers Union. Through the union, the cartel could solicit bribes, extort payoffs and enforce its monopoly. The cartel worked its controlled industry by charging a tax of approximately $1.00 to $2.00 for almost every window replacement, public and private, sold in New York City. The iron fists of Casso and captain Peter “Fat Pete” Chiodo raised Amuso’s shares in the cartel.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=dispute-with-accetturo></span>Dispute with Accetturo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The bloodletting only increased after Amuso named Casso as his underboss in 1988. Toward the late 1980s, Amuso and Casso began arguing with Anthony “Tumac” Accetturo, head of the family’s powerful New Jersey faction, “The Jersey Crew,” about the profit that Accetturo sent to the family administration. Accetturo had only been sending $50,000 a year to New York, but Amuso and Casso wanted half of the Jersey Crew’s yearly take. When Accetturo refused, Amuso stripped him of his rank.</p><p>In the fall of 1988, the entire Jersey Crew was summoned to meet with Amuso in Brooklyn. Ten of the crew’s members showed up for the meeting. However, fearing that they were being set up to be killed, they all abruptly drove off. In a fury, Amuso ordered the entire Jersey Crew killed — the now-infamous “whack Jersey” order. Soon, the entire New Jersey crew had gone into hiding, decimating the Lucchese interests in New Jersey. Amuso and Casso went on to eliminate anyone on even the merest suspicion that they might be defectors or if they were considered potential rivals. Over the next 12 months, most of the New Jersey crew members returned to the family. Amuso told the crew members who came back that Accetturo was an outlaw and needed to be disposed of. Amuso sent hitmen to Florida to search for Accetturo. However, what Amuso didn’t realize was that Accetturo was jailed in New Jersey for refusing to testify in front a state panel. Accetturo would later become an informant. Accetturo’s former protégé and longtime rival, Michael “Mad Dog” Taccetta, who was also despised by Amuso, reputedly took over Lucchese’s Jersey Crew, the nickname of their faction in Northern New Jersey, toward his conviction in 1993, before Accetturo eventually agreed to become an informant.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=fugitives-and-convictions></span>Fugitives and convictions<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In early 1991, Amuso and Casso were indicted as part of a racketeering investigation. Acting on prior knowledge, Amuso and Casso went into hiding. Amuso named Alphonse “Little Al” D’Arco as acting boss. But the bloodshed of Vic Amuso and Tony Casso wasn’t over yet, as Lucchese <i>caporegime</i> Peter “Fat Pete” Chiodo was charged with violations of the RICO act in 1991.</p><p>Suspecting that Chiodo had turned informer, Amuso decided to have Chiodo killed. On May 8, 1991, three gunmen shot Chiodo 12 times, but failed to kill him. A few weeks later, Amuso sent word to Chiodo’s attorneys that his wife had been marked for death. This violated a longstanding Mafia rule that women are not to be harmed. Later, a hit team nearly killed Chiodo’s sister.</p><p>The move backfired spectacularly, as Chiodo became a government informant and agreed to testify against several major heads of the Five Families, including Amuso, that same year. Chiodo revealed details of the entire <i>Windows Case</i> operation, several murder and conspiracy charges, loansharking and extortion, as well as money laundering and drug trafficking operations around Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx.</p><p>Amuso issued several other orders that led many inside and outside the Lucchese family to conclude he was no longer acting rationally. He and Casso crafted a list of 49 people that they wanted dead—half of whom were Lucchese wiseguys. He also ordered D’Arco to bring in a bomb expert from the Philadelphia crime family as part of a plan to blow up Gambino boss John Gotti. Amuso then turned his wrath on D’Arco, whom he held responsible for the failed hit on Chiodo. He effectively demoted D’Arco by naming a four-man panel to run the family in his absence.</p><p>FBI agents captured Amuso at a suburban mall outside Scranton, Pennsylvania. There were strong indications that the FBI had been tipped off by someone with knowledge of the clandestine telephone system Amuso used to pass on orders. Shortly afterward, D’Arco was set up to be killed at a meeting of top Lucchese leaders at a Manhattan hotel. D’Arco spotted a man carrying a gun under his shirt. The man later went to the bathroom — and when he came out, the gun was gone. Realizing that the next guy to come out of the bathroom would likely come out shooting, D’Arco fled for his life and turned state’s evidence. His testimony, and that of Chiodo and many others, proved to be devastating to Amuso’s case, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1992.</p><p>Casso managed to remain free for two more years until he himself was apprehended in 1993. By then, Amuso had been seething over the circumstances of his arrest for some time, and had come to believe that Casso had tipped off the FBI in hopes of seizing the boss’ mantle for himself. In late 1993, Amuso removed Casso as underboss and decreed that all Lucchese mafiosi should consider him a pariah–in effect, banishing his comrade of some three decades from the family. Casso responded by turning informer himself. After the incarcerations of both Amuso and Casso, the U.S. government learned that they each had, allegedly, ordered more than 10-12 slayings while they were fugitives and while on trial, using corrupt NYPD cops Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa as their personal hit men.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=imprisoned-lucchese-boss></span>Imprisoned Lucchese Boss<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=new-lucchese-acting-boss></span>New Lucchese Acting boss<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After Amuso’s indictment in 1991 with the testimony provided by former <i>acting boss</i> Alphonse “Little Al” D’Arco, Amuso promoted his <i>caporegime</i> Joseph “Little Joe” DeFede, to <i>acting boss</i>, with the help of the <i>Ruling Panel</i> members, Steven “Wonderboy” Crea, Anthony “Bowat” Baratta, Salvatore “Sal” Avellino and consigliere Frank “Big Frank” Lastorino in 1991. It was around this time that Lastorino used the indictments of Amuso and Anthony “Gaspipe” Casso to take advantage of the situation and gained much of the authority in the family when he aligned himself with Brooklyn faction leaders George “Georgie Neck” Zappola, Frank “Bones” Papagni, Frank Gioia, Jr. and George Conte.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=fearing-rivalry-from-bronx></span>Fearing rivalry from Bronx<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In early 1992, Amuso feared that rivalry was being developed in the Lucchese crime family, as some mobsters thought, with Amuso out of the way, that they could take over. The rivals were the old Bronx faction of the family, and Amuso felt he had to prove that he was still in charge. On April 3, 1992, Aniello “Neil” Migliore, one of the most powerful capos of the family, was celebrating the birthday of a friend’s granddaughter in a Westbury, New York restaurant on Long Island. During the party, a gunman in a passing car fired one or two shotgun blasts through the restaurant window, hitting Migliore in the head and chest. Despite his wounds, Migliore survived. The attempt on his life did not sway Migliore away from the crime family, though, as he kept operating throughout the 1990s.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bronx-brooklyn-rivalry></span> <span id=Bronx_.26_Brooklyn_rivalry></span>Bronx & Brooklyn rivalry<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As Amuso allegedly attempted to kill Aniello “Neil” Migliore from the Bronx faction in 1992, he chose another Bronx faction-leader named Steven “Wonderboy” Crea as the new and powerful underboss of the Lucchese crime family to keep rivals from the Bronx in line. However, this decision almost triggered a new war within the crime family, as Crea, along with Joseph “Little Joe” DeFede decided to turn the family’s power center away from Brooklyn, New York, and back to the Bronx faction where it had been for decades. This, however, didn’t please the imprisoned boss Vic Amuso and his supporters within the Brooklyn faction. Crime family consigliere, Frank “Big Frank” Lastorino sought to organize the murder of Steven Crea using capos George Zappola, Frank Papagni and Frank Gioia, Jr., and would further plan to use the death of acting boss Steve Crea to gain the control of the Lucchese crime family. U.S. law enforcement also recognized these members as the actual leaders of the family at the time, and even picked them up on wires and bugs saying they were going to kill Gambino crime family boss John “Junior” Gotti, son of John Gotti, and his rival Nicholas “Little Nick” Corozzo to split up the Gambinos. This conspiracy also included Genovese crime family boss Vincent “Chin” Gigante and on-the-lam leader, Anthony “Gaspipe” Casso before he was apprehended. But due to massive indictments of the time, slashing all members of the three families involved in the conspiracy, the plot never succeeded, and Amuso continued to run the family from prison as most of the conspirators themselves were sent to prison.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=restructure-of-the-family></span>Restructure of the family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>During the mid-1990s, the majority of the Brooklyn faction leaders, many of whom were known Amuso’s rivals, were sent to prison on various charges. To keep some sense of stability within the Lucchese crime family, Amuso promoted his loyal friend and Brooklyn capo Louis “Louie Bagels” Daidone to the position of consigliere, replacing Frank Lastorino. Amuso also kept Joseph “Little Joe” DeFede as the crime family’s acting boss. DeFede oversaw important crime family operations such as those in the Garment District, which brought in between $40,000 to $60,000 a month. Amuso kept Stephen “Wonderboy” Crea of the Bronx as the underboss, overseeing the construction and union racketeering operations that made the crime family between $300,000 and $500,000 a month. Daidone was put in control of the crews and street soldiers that took care of all the debt collection and muscle work, basically the collection of gambling and loansharking debts, the extortion operations and allegedly murder for hire. After Daidone was promoted to the number three spot, Long Island caporegime Joseph “Joe C.” Caridi stepped up to run Daidone’s former crew.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-defedes-imprisonment></span> <span id=Joe_DeFede.27s_imprisonment></span>Joe DeFede’s imprisonment<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On April 28, 1998, DeFede was indicted on nine counts of racketeering stemming from his supervision of the crime family rackets in New York’s Garment District from 1992 to 1997. The prosecution reported that since the mid-1980s the Lucchese crime family had been grossing between $40,000 and $60,000 per month from the Garment District rackets they controlled. In December 1998, DeFede pleaded guilty to the charges and received five years in prison. Angry at his guilty plea, Amuso became uncertain of DeFede’s loyalty to the crime family and, in the future, Amuso would regard DeFede as a traitor and thief.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=wonderboys-enormous-profit></span> <span id=Wonderboy.27s_enormous_profit></span>Wonderboy’s enormous profit<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After the imprisonment of Joe DeFede in 1998, Amuso handpicked Bronx faction leader, Steven “Wonderboy” Crea as the new acting boss of the Lucchese crime family. Crea, a loyal Amuso underboss began sending a larger amount of the crime family’s profits to the imprisoned boss, which convinced Amuso that DeFede had been skimming profits from the crime family the whole time he was acting boss. Amuso decided to put out a contract on DeFede’s life in late 1999. On September 6, 2000, Crea and seven other Lucchese members were arrested and jailed on extortion charges. Crea was eventually convicted in 2001 and sentenced to five years in prison. Steven Crea was released from prison in 2006.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=daidone-defede-and-darco></span> <span id=Daidone.2C_DeFede_and_D.27Arco></span>Daidone, DeFede and D’Arco<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Following the imprisonment of Crea in 2001, influential consigliere, Louis “Louie Bagels” Daidone was promoted to acting boss and began to run the day-to-day operations of the crime family. Daidone, at the time, one of the strongest and most dangerous crime family members, would continue to oversee the contract ordered by Amuso on imprisoned former acting boss Joseph “Little Joe” DeFede. DeFede did not know that Amuso had placed a contract on his life but, during DeFede’s imprisonment, he was demoted from capo to soldier and this alerted him to the possibility that he had fallen out of favor with boss Vic Amuso and could be in serious trouble. Upon DeFede’s release from prison on February 5, 2002, it was reported that the former Amuso ally immediately turned to the government for help and became an informant. Federal witnesses Joe DeFede and Alphonse “Little Al” D’Arco gave the U.S. government information regarding Lucchese controlled racketeering operations based around New York City, which helped the federal government continue their decimation of the old Amuso-faction.</p><p>Both D’Arco and DeFede also provided information about rackets such as gambling, loansharking, extortion and even information about some old murders, which led to the indictments of Mafia cops, Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa. Eppolito and Caracappa were allegedly working for and taking large bribes from former Lucchese underboss Anthony “Gaspipe” Casso since the 1980s. The two highly decorated NYPD officers were apparently used by Casso and the Lucchese crime family to gain valuable information about ongoing police investigations and cases concerning New York Mafia member. The two bad cops were also used to lure rivals and possible government informants to their deaths and, in some cases, they apparently executed the victims themselves. Daidone received a life sentence in 2003 on racketeering and murder charges, while more than a dozen other prominent Lucchese crime family members were sent to prison during that same year on various charges.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-committeeruling-panel></span> <span id=The_Committee.2FRuling_Panel></span>The Committee/Ruling Panel<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After the conviction and imprisonment of acting boss Louie Diadone in 2003, Amuso instituted a new ruling panel/committee of influential capos to oversee and run the crime family’s day-to-day activities. Prominent and senior Lucchese <i>capos</i> Aniello “Neil” Migliore, Matthew “Matt” Madonna and Joseph “Joey Dee” DiNapoli were handpicked by Amuso to lead the crime family. These senior capos were chosen as street bosses to work in tandem. Instead of placing one particular member in the official underboss position, Amuso divided the power between three influential capos. Migliore, a former Corallo loyalist and Amuso rival, is now said to be one of the most powerful mobsters in the Lucchese crime family.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=wonderboys-return></span> <span id=Wonderboy.27s_return></span>Wonderboy’s return<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2006, former acting boss Stephen “Wonderboy” Crea was released from prison, and the ruling panel/committee continued to run day-to-day activities of the crime family. In late 2009, ruling panel members Madonna and DiNapoli were indicted on labor racketeering, illegal gambling and extortion charges. In 2009, Steven Crea took over as acting boss of the crime family.</p><p>As of July 2014, Amuso remains the official boss of the Lucchese crime family. Amuso is serving his life sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Cumberland, a federal correctional facility in Maryland on murder and racketeering charges. His Register Number is 38740-079. According to another Mafia historian, Selwyn Raab, Amuso’s bloodthirsty tactics resulted in the loss of more than half the family’s made members — either as a result of being killed, imprisoned or turning informant.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=brooklyns-desantis></span> <span id=Brooklyn.27s_DeSantis></span>Brooklyn’s DeSantis<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In May 2019, government witness and former Lucchese soldier John Pennisi testified in the trail against Eugene Castelle and revealed the current leadership of the crime family. Pennisi testified that in 2017, imprisoned for life boss Vic Amuso sent a letter to Underboss Steven Crea which stated that Brooklyn based mobster Michael “Big Mike” DeSantis would take over as acting boss replacing Bronx based Matthew Madonna. The testimony from Pennisi stated that if the Bronx faction refused to step aside, imprisoned boss Amuso had approved of a hit list that included a captain and several members of the Bronx faction. During Pennisi’s testimony, he revealed that the Lucchese family operates with a total of seven crews – two in The Bronx, two on Long Island, one in Manhattan, one in New Jersey, and Castellucci’s-Brooklyn crew (formerly Amuso-Casso’s old crew) which is now based in Tottenville section of Staten Island. Law-enforcement agents have stated that Brooklyn based mobster Patty “Red” Dellorusso is the new acting underboss and that The Bronx based mobster Andrew DeSimone is the new Consigliere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fq7akwM6rZJqlpai8bq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6ywJyrZpuRp7KmvoyarpqqlKh6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqK6w2ajop6VYsC1u9GyZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvictor-amuso-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvictor-amuso-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvictor-amuso-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvictor-amuso-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvictor-amuso-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvictor-amuso-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-matteo-messina-denaro-s-wife-is-the-mafia-boss-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-matteo-messina-denaro-s-wife-is-the-mafia-boss-married.html>Who Is Matteo Messina Denaros Wife?
