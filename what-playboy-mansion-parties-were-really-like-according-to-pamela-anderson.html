Once the mansion security found out that his guest wasn't brother Owen, <a href=#>Wilson was kicked out of the party and temporarily banned.</a></p><p>The actor recalls the moment, "I got DNA-ed from the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. That means "do not admit" - that's their special word. I tried to get a friend in and I'd shown up and they said 'Who are you with' and I'm like 'I'm with my brother Owen' and they're like 'We need to see him. It was actually my friend Eckelman, who doesn't look anything like Owen."</p><p>He continues, "I was not allowed to go there for a year and a half. I had to make kind of a tearful phone call to Mary, the woman who kind of runs the operation. I said, 'Mary what I did was stupid. It was wrong. Hef's [Hugh Hefner] been so generous to me...' I actually did, I think, cry on the telephone!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have always wondered what it was like to be a part of a mansion party.

Pam revealed, "It was all wild, but respectful. The men were elegant, and you wanted to badly get the most charismatic man to notice you," she said. "Girls were everywhere, giggling and laughing."</p><p>In her new memoir Love, Pamela, the Baywatch star went into detail about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her first time ever entering the mansion</a>. Anderson was overwhelmed by the amount of famous faces she had met.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I wasn’t a pop culture fanatic — I rarely knew the names of people or the names of their characters. Was that Tony Curtis? James Caan? There’s Rambo, surrounded by pretty girls. I met so many people that night, names and faces I slightly recognized — Chachi Spicoli, maybe, could that be Cher? — a whirlwind of personalities."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Did Playboy Really Have A Secret Tunnel For A-List Celebs?

He looked toward me, and we smiled at each other. I took a deep breath as he passed through his friends and brushed by gorgeous girls politely. But his energy and charm felt directed toward me. I had to look away — it made my skin burn, such a funny feeling."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Hefner's reputation took a hit following his passing and the controversial stories, he played a positive role in Anderson's life.</p><h2 id=pamela-anderson-revealed-that-hugh-hefner-changed-her-life-in-the-best-way-possible>Pamela Anderson Revealed That Hugh Hefner Changed Her Life In The Best Way Possible</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hugh-hefner-looking-upset.jpg><p>In a now-deleted Instagram post, <a href=#>Pamela Anderson wrote a tribute to Hugh Hefner</a> following his passing. Anderson revealed the major influence Hefner played in her life.</p><p>"I am me because of you. You taught me everything important about freedom and respect. Outside of my family. You were the most important person in my life."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Donald Trump Jr. Visited The Playboy Mansion And His Experience Was Nothing Like His Father's</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Everything anyone loves about me is because you understood me. Accepted me and encouraged me to be myself. Love like no one else. Live recklessly With unfiltered abandon. You said the magazine was about a girl like me. That I embody the spirit you fantasized about. I was the one. You said."</p><p>Anderson would also reveal that her time with Playboy pushed her confidence and helped 'to get her power back'.</p><p>"I was painfully shy and I hated that feeling. That's why I did it. I just didn't want that feeling any more. Doing that first photoshoot gave me this little kind of portal on what it felt like to be a sensual woman. My sexuality was mine. I took my power back."</p><p>Clearly, Anderson had a different experience compared to some of the other Playmates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr2trdibprJlnZa7tLXOp2SpmaKptqa%2FjLCcq51dp7KiuMuyZKWhm5p6oq%2FCqKmdoZ6cerW7jKmYpp2clnqiusOeqaynnmQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-playboy-mansion-parties-were-really-like-according-to-pamela-anderson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-playboy-mansion-parties-were-really-like-according-to-pamela-anderson.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-playboy-mansion-parties-were-really-like-according-to-pamela-anderson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-playboy-mansion-parties-were-really-like-according-to-pamela-anderson.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-playboy-mansion-parties-were-really-like-according-to-pamela-anderson.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-playboy-mansion-parties-were-really-like-according-to-pamela-anderson.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./giselle-guilmette.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./giselle-guilmette.html>Giselle Guilmette</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./teyana-taylor-addresses-wi-fi-issue-during-2023-bet-award.html>Teyana Taylor Addresses Wi-Fi Issue During 2023 BET Award</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./teyana-taylor-addresses-wi-fi-issue-during-2023-bet-award.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
