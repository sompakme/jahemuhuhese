After all, <a href=#>Spears has released a slew of incredibly beloved songs</a> that helped <a href=#>her build an impressive net worth</a>.</p><p>While there is no doubt that Spears will go down in history, the sad truth is that drama in her personal life has also made her a tabloid staple. Since there is constant reporting about her, many of Spears' fans still don't know <a href=#>what happened between her and Selena Gomez</a>. In May 2024, Spears' personal life landed in the headlines again because of a vicious fight she allegedly got into.</p><p>This article will reveal why <strong>fans worried about Britney Spears after reports surfaced she got into a vicious fight</strong>. Then, the article will look at <strong>how Spears reacted to the reports about her alleged fight</strong> with her boyfriend in May 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears-alleged-fight-with-her-boyfriend-at-a-hotel-left-fans-worried-about-her>Britney Spears Alleged Fight With Her Boyfriend At A Hotel Left Fans Worried About Her</h2><p>On May 2nd, 2024, TMZ published an article about an alleged incident involving Britney Spears and her ex-boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz. According to that report, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spears and Soliz got into a huge fight</a> in The Chateau Marmont where she had a room</strong>.</p><p>Of course, the term huge fight is subjective so it is important to quantify what that means in this situation. According to TMZ, the fight was so out of control that other hotel guests <strong>feared that Spears may have been suffering a mental breakdown</strong>. That said, there is no indication that the witnesses had enough mental health expertise to credibly come to that conclusion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/this-is-the-moment-fans-started-noticing-britney-spears-_gr-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to TMZ, Spears and Soliz were being so belligerent with hotel staff that the police were called and arrived at 10:30 PM. Following that, the duo reportedly went back to her room where they continued to party and drink before something went bad between them.</p><p>What is the simplified timeline of Britney Spears’ conservatorship, according to Biography?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Event:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Timeline:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Britney Spears hospitalized twice for mental health evaluations</p></td><td><p>January 2008</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jamie Spears files for conservatorship</p></td><td><p>February 1, 2008</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Conservatorship extended for the first time</p></td><td><p>October 28, 2008</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Britney Spears addresses conservatorship for first time publicly</p></td><td><p>September 27, 2016</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Britney Spears reportedly requests to end conservatorship</p></td><td><p>May 10, 2019</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Framing Britney Spears documentary airs</p></td><td><p>February 5, 2021</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The conservatorship ends</p></td><td><p>Nov 12, 2021</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/how-a-britney-spears-scandal-almost-ruined-dr-phil-and-oprah-s-relationship-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Oprah Winfrey Questioned Dr. Phil's Ethics Over How He Handled Britney Spears' Scandal</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dr. Phil's handling of Britney Spears' past scandals reportedly made Oprah Winfrey very upset with him.</span><p>Based on TMZ's reporting the fighting in the hotel room may have resulted in Spears injuring her leg. The outlet also reported that witnesses <strong>claimed Spears was "out of control" and screaming</strong> which is why other guests thought she might be having a breakdown.</p><p>Ultimately, TMZ reports that the paramedics were called and arrived at the hotel to potentially help Spears at 12:40 AM.</p><p>As a part of TMZ's report, they published photos of a person who appears to be Spears that seemingly were taken outside the hotel. In the images, the person who appears to be Spears looks like they are wrapped in a cover and clutching a pillow to their chest as they walk barefoot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/britney-spears-world-premiere-of-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After TMZ's report spread online, some people judged Spears harshly. On the other hand, a post about the incident on the r/BritneySpears subreddit showed how the pop star's fans were mostly concerned for her.</p><p>Most notably, the second highest-upvoted response to the incident wished that Spears would be single for a while to protect her from people with bad intent.</p><p>"She would be safer if she didn’t date any men for a while.

As a result, unlike in the past when people could make claims about Spears that went unanswered by her, she can now join the conversation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-britney-spears-pay-a-fortune-for-a-treatment-she-didn-t-want-that-made-her-lose-control-of-her-legs_.jpg><p>After the reports that Spears and her boyfriend got into a huge fight at The Chateau Marmont surfaced, she only took hours to express her side of the story. In this case, Spears commented on the drama with an Instagram post.</p><p>By far the most telling part of Spears' Instagram post was the first sentence. After all, the pop star used the first sentence to bluntly <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">state that the reports about Spear's alleged fight were false</a></strong>. “Just to let people know … the news is fake !!!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the term "fake news" is most closely associated with Donald Trump, it is something that more and more celebrities are calling out each year. The sad reason for that is inaccurate reports spread online quicker than ever before thanks to social media. One example of that is the fact that Spears was the victim of a death hoax in 2016.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/why-many-see-millie-bobby-brown-as-the-new-britney-spears_-the-truth-about-the-scary-similarities-between-their-careers.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Endless Criticism Of Millie Bobby Brown Is Eerily Similar To Britney Spears' Tragic Career Trajectory</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>After Millie Bobby Brown became a star at a young age just like Britney Spears, she is now dealing with a huge problem the pop star has grappled with.</span><p>From there, Spears' Instagram post then went on to imply that <strong>the photos that allegedly showed the aftermath of the fight were fake</strong>. Spears also wrote about how she was becoming more powerful.</p><p>"Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that !!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday !!! Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie ??? Goddesses out there, I’m reaching my higher power and furthermore, I hope you guys are too !!!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/britney-spears-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interesting twist, Spears' Instagram post took a surprising turn. Spears began writing about seemingly unrelated things. Then Spears called herself out for not knowing why she included that part. “I need a new toothbrush right now !!! PS … I need an espresso !!! PSS … Not sure why I feel the need to share this … I guess I’m just a girl and I’m on my period so I’m bitchy … s**t !!!”</p><p>Aside from Spears' fake news claim, the section at the end of her post arguably was the most interesting. The reason for that was that <strong>Spears claimed she suffered an injury</strong>, paramedics showed up to treat her, and she was planning to move.</p><p>“I also twisted my ankle last night and paramedics showed up at my door illegally. They never came in my room but I felt completly harassed. I’m moving to Boston !!!
