Even Foxx's daughter, Corinne, has adopted her dad's famous surname for her own career. It's not surprising though; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two are pretty close</a>.</p><p>But why did Eric Bishop decide to become Jamie Foxx in the first place?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Movie Stars Who Changed Their Name For Hollywood</a></span></p><p>He's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had a pretty interesting acting career</a>, and his success can't exactly be attributed to the name he chose. But Jamie's early foray into comedic work helped shape his decision to change his name.</p><p>The story goes, notes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Times</a>, that Eric Bishop was always funny growing up, but he didn't set foot on a stage until someone dared him to do stand-up comedy. And while his birth name was probably just fine for most types of acting work, comedy required a particular strategy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jamie recalled that he originally chose his new first name because it was "ambiguous." The as-yet-inexperienced comedian happened to notice that female comedians were often called up first. Selecting a gender-neutral name meant he may have better odds at heading up first. But it also meant no one could really be biased against him because they wouldn't know his gender ahead of time.</p><p>It's a bit of an interesting conundrum, especially for women who've struggled to be taken seriously while carrying a more feminine name. Diving into research on name biases is a pretty involved pastime. But Jamie was suitably "androgynous," and so it went.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Foxx's case, he selected a first name he felt he could live with but would help ensure he had a simpler time of fighting against any biases. As for the last name, there's another story there.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent</a> quoted Foxx as saying that he chose his surname in tribute to Redd Foxx, the headlining comedian from 'Sanford and Son.' And though he might've thought, early on his career, that he had some big shoes to fill, it turns out that Foxx made his name his own.</p><p>In chatting with The Independent, Foxx explained that part of the reason he was so fantastic in the film 'Ray' was that his grandmother, who could barely afford to raise him, insisted he take piano lessons as a child.</p><p>It was that rough childhood -- complete with being essentially abandoned by his birth parents (his grandmother's adopted daughter and her boyfriend) -- that helped shape Jamie Foxx into the man he is today. And he probably doesn't regret any of it -- especially choosing the name that would carry him through to significant fame and fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are Jamie Foxx's Two Baby Mamas?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecmapKKdXZu8ucSMnJ%2Bappeaeqm10malmqWVZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-why-jamie-foxx-really-changed-his-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhere-s-why-jamie-foxx-really-changed-his-name.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-why-jamie-foxx-really-changed-his-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhere-s-why-jamie-foxx-really-changed-his-name.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-why-jamie-foxx-really-changed-his-name.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-why-jamie-foxx-really-changed-his-name.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hickory-contest-will-decide-name-of-union-square-event-area-wsoc-tv.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hickory-contest-will-decide-name-of-union-square-event-area-wsoc-tv.html>Hickory contest will decide name of Union Square event area WSOC TV</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./asap-rocky-stars-in-another-fenty-skin-ad-this-time-with-rihanna.html>ASAP Rocky Stars in Another Fenty Skin Ad This Time With Rihanna</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./asap-rocky-stars-in-another-fenty-skin-ad-this-time-with-rihanna.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
