Whose entertainment career spanned seven decades, known for her lighthearted bawdy double entendres&nbsp;and breezy sexual independence.</strong><span id=more-165872></span></p><p>West was active in&nbsp;vaudeville and on the stage in New York City before moving to Hollywood to become a comedian, actress, and writer in the motion picture industry, as well as appearing on radio and television. The&nbsp;American Film Institute&nbsp;named her 15th among the&nbsp;greatest female stars of classic American cinema. She usually portrayed women who accepted their lives of dubious virtue with flippant good humor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mae-west-age></span>Mae West Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>West known as Mary Jane West was born on August 17, 1893, in Kings County, New York. She was 87 years old as of 1980 before she died.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mae-west-family></span>Mae West Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her father was John Patrick West, a livery stable owner and prizefighter known as Battlin` Jack West, and her mother was Matilda (Tillie) Delker-Doelger, a corset, and fashion model. Mae had a brother and a sister; she was the middle child. Her family had a Protestant background. Her paternal grandmother, Mary Jane for whom she was named, was of Irish Catholic descent and West’s paternal grandfather, John Edwin West, was of English–Scots descent and a ship’s rigger.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mae-west-husbands></span>Mae West Husbands<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>West was married on April 11, 1911, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Frank Szatkus (1892–1966),&nbsp;whose stage name was Frank Wallace a fellow vaudevillian whom she met in 1909.&nbsp;She kept the marriage a secret, but a filing clerk discovered the marriage certificate in 1935 and alerted the press. The final divorce decree was granted on May 7, 1943.</p><p>In August 1913, she met&nbsp;Guido Deiro (1886–1950), an Italian-born vaudeville headliner and star of the piano-accordion. Her affair went “very deep, hittin’ on all the emotions”. West later said Marriage is a great institution. I’m not ready for an institution yet.</p><p>West later became involved with Chester Rybinski, one of the muscle-men in her Las Vegas stage show, who was 30 years her junior. He later changed his name to Paul Novak. Their relationship lasted until West’s death.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mae-west-career></span>Mae West Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mae West began her professional career in vaudeville in the Hal Clarendon Stock Company in 1907 at the age of 14. Initially, she performed under the stage name of “Baby Mae” and also used the alias of “Jane Mast” in her early career.</p>She made her Broadway debut in a 1911 review ‘A La Broadway’ put on by her former dancing teacher, Ned Wayburn. The show was not successful, but Mae got noticed for her skills. She went on to appear in several other plays over the next few years, earning a reputation as a sex symbol because of her risqué performances.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mae-west-death-famous-quotes></span>Mae West Death Famous Quotes<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li class=Qynugf>You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.</li><li>When I’m good I’m very, very good, but when I’m bad, I’m better.</li><li>Too much of a good thing can be taxing.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mae-west-songs></span>Mae West Songs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul class=text-medium><li class=PLG><span class=PLT>The Temperance Lecture</span></li><li class=PLW><span class=PLT>The Day I Drank A Glass of Water</span></li><li class=PLG><span class=PLT>Frankie & Johnny</span></li><li class=PLW><span class=PLT>My Man Friday</span></li><li class=PLG><span class=PLT>Page 54</span></li><li class=PLW><span class=PLT>That’s All Brother</span></li><li class=PLG><span class=PLT>Pardon Me For Loving and Running</span></li><li class=PLW><span class=PLT>Put It Off Until Tomorrow</span></li><li class=PLG><span class=PLT>Slow Down</span></li><li class=PLW><span class=PLT>Come Up and See Me Sometime</span></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mae-west-height-and-weight></span>Mae West Height And Weight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her height is 1.52 m and weight 55 kg.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mae-west-net-worth></span>Mae West Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>West was an American actress, singer, screenwriter, playwright, and sex symbol who had a&nbsp;net worth of $20 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mae-west-instagram></span>Mae West Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mae-west-twitter></span>Mae West Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Smoking #weed is like the Aurora Borealis for the brain. #420 #MedicalMarijuana #marijuana #LegalizeIt</p><p>— Mae West (@RealMaeWest) April 6, 2018</p><h1 class="spaced spaced-xl spaced-top spaced-bottom">Remembering the life and career of Mae West</h1><p class="caption-text spaced spaced-top spaced-xs flex">Mae West&nbsp;is photographed during the early days of her stage and movie career.

(AP)</p>Legendary actress, the playwright and comedian Mary Jane “Mae” West, born in Brooklyn on Aug. 17, 1893, was known throughout her 70-year career for her witty sexuality and saying things like, “Between two evils, I always choose the one I’ve never tried before.” West was indomitably herself until her death on Nov. 22, 1980, in Hollywood, from stroke-related complications.
