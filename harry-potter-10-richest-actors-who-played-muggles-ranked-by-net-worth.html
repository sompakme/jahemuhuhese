Perhaps the highest-profile muggles in Harry Potter land are the Dursley, those wretched humans who treated Harry so badly. And don't forget Aunt Marge! Across the&nbsp;Harry Potter and&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchises, muggles get something of a bad rap. Granted, the breed fairs better in&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts, with the introduction of Jacob Kowalski.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Mistakes You Missed In The Harry Potter Universe</a></span></p><p>But what are the actors worth? Read on. Here are 10 muggle actors who play muggles and what they are worth. Unless otherwise credited, we used&nbsp;celebritynetworth.com&nbsp;and celebnetworths.org.</p><h2 id=eric-sykes---630-000>Eric Sykes - $630,000</h2><p>While not particularly well-known in America, Eric Sykes loomed very largely in the U.K. He was a well-loved actor and stand-up<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> comedian</a>, what the Brits would call a "cheeky chappy". He was a well-respected comic writer who worked with the likes of Peter Sellers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He played, very briefly,&nbsp;caretaker Frank Bryce in the&nbsp;Goblet of Fire.&nbsp;Seeing a light on in Riddle House, Bryce goes to investigate and ends up dead, at the hands of a re-emerging Voldemort. When he died in 2012, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mirror</a> reported he left his widow some $630,000.</p><h2 id=harry-edward-melling---2-million>Harry Edward Melling - $2 Million</h2><p>He was Dudley Dursley, a character who seemed to totally enjoy harassing Harry Potter in and around 4 Privet Drive. Harry got him back, once or twice. Remember the snake pit at the zoo?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Ridiculously Expensive Things The Cast Of Harry Potter Has Bought</a></span></p><p>Harry Edward Melling is 30-years-old and since&nbsp;Harry Potter wrapped, he has been busy, busy, busy, mostly acting in television shows such as the BBC's&nbsp;War of the Worlds&nbsp;and&nbsp;His Dark Material.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the stage, he's done everything from Shakespeare to farce. And, no, before you ask, he is not still overweight. He's doing well, worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$2 million.</a></p><h2 id=ian-kelly---2-5-million>Ian Kelly - $2.5 Million</h2><p>Ian Kelly is one talented guy. He acts, on stage and screen, is a playwright, and historian who has published a biography of Casanova. If that weren't enough, he is also a journalist who writes for papers like the&nbsp;New York Times.&nbsp;Talk about an over-achiever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Very briefly, he and Michelle Fairley play Hermione's parents in the&nbsp;Deathly Hallows Part I.&nbsp;It's one of the most touching scenes in the movie, as Hermione erases their memories before setting off on her crusade with Harry and Ron. Over-achiever Kelly is worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$2.5 million</a>.</p><h2 id=michelle-fairley---3-million>Michelle Fairley - $3 Million</h2><p>She was Mrs. Granger, Hermione's mom, in the&nbsp;<i>Deathly Hallows </i>Part I. Well, it wasn't much of role. It was probably her smallest gig ever. Michelle hales from Northern Ireland and has been acting since she was a teenager. She's amassed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3 million</a> fortune. Notable roles include playing Catelyn Stark in&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;and Ava Hessington in&nbsp;Suits.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn These 10 Things And You'll Become A Game Of Thrones Expert</a></span></p><p>There's a lot of cross-over between&nbsp;Game of Thrones and&nbsp;Harry Potter. You probably didn't realize it, but more than a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dozen actors</a> have played in both.</p><h2 id=dan-fogler---4-million>Dan Fogler - $4 Million</h2><p>Dan Fogler plays muggle Jacob Kowalski in<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them&nbsp;</a>franchise. The New Yorker is a funny guy, as anyone can see from his freaked out comic turn as bank employee Jacob.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dan is a creature of both the stage and screen, having won a Tony Award or two. He's also got a nice little sideline doing voiceovers, most notably for 2008's Kung Fu Panda.&nbsp;Another overachiever, he's also a playwright and occasionally shows up in music videos. With a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4 million,</a> he's done well for himself.</p><h2 id=jenn-murray---5-million>Jenn Murray - $5 Million</h2><p>Jenn Murray plays Chastity Barebone, the adopted daughter of Mary Lou Barebone in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Chastity is the goody two shoes of the family, abiding by her mother's strict rules, unlike her other two adoptive siblings. Mary Lou can get very nasty.</p><p>30-something Jenn was born in Nothern Ireland and has been working in film and TV for around ten years. She's pulled in some impressive gigs, including a turn in the Maleficent franchise and critically acclaimed Brooklyn. She's earned her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million</a> net worth, according to&nbsp;celebstrendingnow.com.</p><h2 id=richard-griffiths---5-million>Richard Griffiths - $5 Million</h2><p>Vernon Dursley is not a nice man, is he? But Richard Griffiths was. People like Daniel Radcliffe have praised him for his patience and mentoring skills. Before&nbsp;Harry Potter, he was best known in the U.K. for his portrayal of chef/detective Henry Crabbe in&nbsp;Pie in the Sky.&nbsp;His net worth? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Griffiths was also a very talented stage actor, winning awards such as the Lawrence Olivier Award for Best Actor. He appeared on Broadway with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Radcliffe</a> in&nbsp;Equus. That's the one where Radcliffe went without clothes on stage. He said Griffiths helped him get his nerves under control. Starkers in front of an audience would tend to jangle the nerves.</p><h2 id=fiona-shaw---5-million>Fiona Shaw - $5 Million</h2><p>Fiona Shaw smashed her comic performance as priggish and snobbish Petunia Dursley. Like Vernon, it was hard to find anything to like about her. Shaw is a seasoned actress of stage and screen who has also turned her hand to directing theater and even opera. Opera? That can't be easy. She earned her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million</a> net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Straight Celebs Rumored To Be Secretly Gay</a></span></p><p>The Irish actress is openly gay, having previously been in a relationship with actress Saffron Burrows. She's done star turns in shows such a the BBC's&nbsp;<i>Killing Eve</i> where she trots out a cut glass upper-class English accent. It's put on. If you talked to her face to face you would totally know she is Irish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pam-ferris---6-million>Pam Ferris - $6 Million</h2><p>Pam Ferris is almost unrecognizable as Aunt Marge in&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, especially when she inflates and floats off into outer space. Like Vernon and Petunia, it's hard to find anything to like about Marge.</p><p>Ferris, now in her 70s has had a long career, both as a serious and comedic actress, appearing in TV shows such as&nbsp;Call the Midwife, Luther,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Midsomer Murders.&nbsp;But the thing nobody will ever forget was when she shared a bath with actor David Jason while eating dinner in TV's iconic comedy The Darling Buds of May.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $6 million</a>. She's earned it.</p><h2 id=samantha-morton---10-million>Samantha Morton - $10 Million</h2><p>Samantha Morton is an Oscar-nominated and Golden Globe-winning English actress who plays Mary Lou Barebone in&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.&nbsp; Mary Lou is a No-Maj, i.e. muggle who, while she believes in magic, is sworn to eradicate it. Let's face it, she's not a very nice person. Just ask her three adopted children, Chastity, Modesty, and Credence.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Super-Rich Stars Who Came From Nothing</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Morton, who survived a debilitating stroke and bounced back, is said to be difficult to work with, not afraid to get in the face of crew members she thinks are being unhelpful.
