However, he did take a bold approach on Taylor Swift, suggesting that her songs were written by somebody else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview with the LA Times, the artist said, "Billie Eilish? I think she’s exceptional. Taylor Swift? She doesn’t write her own songs."</p><p>Albarn went on to state that co-writing doesn't really count as coming up with a song on your own. Fans felt as though this was another shot at Taylor Swift.</p><p>"[Co-writing] doesn’t count. I know what co-writing is. Co-writing is very different to writing. I’m not hating on anybody, I’m just saying there’s a big difference between a songwriter and a songwriter who co-writes. Doesn’t mean that the outcome can’t be really great."</p><p>He added, "A really interesting songwriter is Billie Eilish and her brother. I’m more attracted to that than to Taylor Swift. It’s just darker — less endlessly upbeat. Way more minor and odd. I think she’s exceptional."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar52895634.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/your-paragraph-text-2024-04-04t154154-287.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Alanis Morissette Admitted To Howard Stern Her Experience With Taylor Swift Was The Opposite Of What She Expected ">Alanis Morissette Admitted To Howard Stern Her Experience With Taylor Swift Was The Opposite Of What She Expected</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Alanis Morissette told Howard Stern she realized the times had changed following her work alongside Taylor Swift.</p><p>Fans can clearly see that Albarn was taking major risks during the interview, suggesting that Swift was getting help for the writing of her songs, while he basically labeled Billie Eilish as the better storyteller between the two. As expected, Swift's army didn't take kindly to the artist's words and, in addition, Swift herself took to Twitter, addressing the bold claims Albarn had made.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-fired-back-following-the-la-times-article>Taylor Swift Fired Back Following The LA Times Article</h2><p>Swift fired back on Twitter, calling Albarn's words "damaging."

Until now. He’s gassing on two female talents. I am fed up of Taylor Swift being slagged off. She does SO much ALONE Re toxic male conduct. Appearing humble but in fact sharpening the blood.

And this from the man who gave us such insightful lyrics as “woo hoo” and also “woo hoo."</p><p>"When you're at the very top of your game there's always going to be someone trying to bring you down. Everyone who matters respects you and your work. Adore you, Taylor! Thank you for all the beautiful music you have written!"</p><p>Albarn did react to Swift's feedback, and apologized for what had taken place.</p><h2 id=damon-albarn-apologized-and-said-his-words-were-manipulated-for-clickbait>Damon Albarn Apologized And Said His Words Were Manipulated For Clickbait</h2><p>Albarn reacted to the tweet, and called the moment "clickbait."

I had a conversation about songwriting and, sadly it was reduced to clickbait. I apologize unreservedly and unconditionally. The last thing I would want to do is discredit your songwriting.
