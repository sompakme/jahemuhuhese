It's not easy for young stars to make a big name for themselves, but we have seen names like <a href=#>Tom Holland</a> and <a href=#>Zendaya</a> both make a huge strides in recent years thanks to being able to stand out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Nicolas Cage</a> was able to become a wealthy Hollywood star thanks to standing out in his younger years, and he has taken his fortune and has made some headline-grabbing purchases.</p><p>Let's take a look at Nicolas Cage's haunted New Orleans house and learn why he made such a bizarre purchase years ago.</p><h2 id=nicolas-cage-is-a-major-hollywood-star>Nicolas Cage Is A Major Hollywood Star</h2><p>In what has genuinely been a unique career in the entertainment industry, Nicolas Cage is a performer who has both dazzled and baffled fans for years on end. Despite coming from the infamous Coppola family tree, Cage has been able to forge his own name in the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter the size or scale of the project, Nicolas Cage has proven himself to be a performer who will give 100% with each outing. This is been some thing that has been both a blessing and a curse for the actor. Yes, it has led him to winning an Oscar, but it has also generated him some negative buzz, as well.</p><p>Nevertheless, it has helped Cage stand out and cement his legacy on the big screen, and it has also helped the actor generate a net worth of $25 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>Thanks to having a sizable fortune to play around with, Nicolas Cage has gone out of his way to get his hands on some unique items.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Nicolas Cage Says A Mime Stalked Him And Fans Aren't As Shocked As They Should Be</a></span></p><h2 id=cage-has-made-some-eccentric-purchases>Cage Has Made Some Eccentric Purchases</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Never one to shy away from the weird or the wonderful, Nicolas Cage has certainly made his fair share of bizarre purchases through the years. Naturally, some of these unique purchases have been able to snag some headlines.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goliath</a>, one of the craziest things that Nicolas Cage has ever purchased is a set of shrunken heads, which he keeps in his house. He has also preemptively bought his own tomb, which is bizarrely shaped like a pyramid. Again, Cage has always done things his way, and this includes the way that he spends his fortune.</p>Cage also stole headlines when he outbid Leonardo DiCaprio for a dinosaur skull, which he ended up having to return. Then, of course, we have massive luxuries that are only reserved for the rich and the famous. Those luxuries are quite pedestrian when compared to pyramid tombs and dinosaurs skulls.As interesting as all of that is, Nicolas Cage also made waves when he got himself what is considered to be a genuine haunted house in New Orleans. <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Dark Reason Nicolas Cage Was Bullied While Making 'Fast Times At Ridgemont High'</a></span><h2>Cage Lived In A Haunted Mansion For Inspiration</h2>[EMBED_INSTA]https://www.instagram.com/p/CT7lTDfr7vT/[/EMBED_INSTA]So, why in the world did Nicolas Cage buy a haunted house and stay there for some time? Turns out, he was looking for some inspiration."The LaLaurie Mansion in New Orleans used to belong to Madame LaLaurie, a well-known 19th century socialite and serial killer. I bought it in 2007, figuring it would be a good place in which to write the great American horror novel. I didn't get too far with the novel," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor said</a> .Separately, Cage mentioned that, "It was indeed considered the "haunted mansion" in New Orleans. You know, other people have beachfront property; I have ghost front property - that's what I always say. I have not experienced anything, but I like a bit of mystery, and the house has such a mystery to it. Some of the stories about it are pretty horrific."This might seem bizarre to some, but for Cage, this was both for inspiration and to fulfill a lifelong fantasy of his. That fantasy? To own his very own piece of Disneyland history."I'm a child of California and I would go to Disneyland quite a bit - I consider myself something of a "Son of Walt" - and those memories had an impact on me. One of the greatest memories would be the haunted mansion at Anaheim, in New Orleans Square, no less. So for me to have the actual thing was the childhood fantasy come true," he said. <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Nicolas Cage Caught On Video Getting Kicked Out Of Vegas Restaurant For Being 'Too Drunk'</a></span> Nicolas Cage might not have whipped up a classic novel while living in a haunted house, but it sure made for a cool story for the actor.
