For example, when a star wins an award and thanks their agents and managers, most viewers can’t wait for them to move on to a more interesting subject.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, when stars bring up their significant others during their acceptance speeches, that can quickly become a lot more intriguing. After all, a lot of people care when <a href=#>celebrity couples break up</a> or when they profess their love for one another publically. On the other hand, most people don’t pay all that much attention to the stories of <a href=#>celebrity spouses who faithfully support their partners and their careers</a>.</p><p>Even though Michael Rapaport has been in the public eye for more than two decades at this point, most of his fans know very little about his wife, Kebe Dunn. For example, very few of Rapaport’s fans have any idea if Dunn is a fan of Rapaport’s often divisive form of humor or if she thinks he would be better off if he kept his mouth shut a lot more often.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is 'Saved By The Bell' Actor Mark-Paul Gosselaar's Wife, And What Does She Do?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=controversial-comments>Controversial Comments</h2><p>Throughout Michael Rapaport’s career, he has crafted an image for himself as pretty much the living embodiment of the stereotypical New Yorker. Seemingly not willing to pull his punches in any way, Rapaport comes across as the type of person who is proud that they have no filter between their brain and his mouth.</p><p>If you are looking for an example of the less controversial side of his sense of humor, all you have to do is take a look at <a href=#>Michael Rapaport's relationship with The Howard Stern Show’s staff</a>. After all, if a celebrity is looking to find an audience that can handle profanity, Stern fans are a perfect fit. On the other hand, Rapaport is no stranger to his humor becoming the subject of controversy and as it turns out, he definitely isn’t the kind of person to back down in the face of a backlash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Howard Stern's Producer Accidentally Almost Ruined His Show</a></span></p><p>In late 2018, Michael Rapaport felt the need to call Ariana Grande out on social media for purely superficial reasons. "Ariana Grande is 27 acts 12, you take off those boots she hides her legs in, the cat eye make up and the genie pony tale and I think there's hotter women working the counter at Starbucks no disrespect to Starbucks". Unsurprisingly, a lot of Grande’s fans quickly came to the pop star’s defense. More importantly, there were a lot of people who couldn't care less about Grande in general who felt that Rapaport was way out of line and called him out as a result.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If most stars saw that there was a consensus online that their conduct was offensive, they would quickly put out a carefully worded statement apologizing and asking for forgiveness. Of course, Michael Rapaport isn’t the typical celebrity by any means. After all, instead of apologizing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapaport doubled down by mocking Ariana Grande on social media once more</a> with a photoshopped image of himself beside her alongside some derisive words. “When Thank You,Next is really life!!! Always Stay Disruptive! Shout out to all the Women at Starbucks!!!” Amazingly enough, the Grande controversy is only one of many Rapaport has gotten himself wrapped up in. With that in mind, it wouldn’t be much of a surprise if his antics frustrated his wife.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kevin Durant Fined 50K For Social Media Tussle With Actor Michael Rapaport</a></span></p><h2 id=dunn-rsquo-s-humor-perspective>Dunn’s Humor Perspective</h2><p>Of course, the only way to truly know how a couple interacts with one another on a day-to-day basis is by being one of the people involved in the relationship. Despite that, based on how a couple interacts while in public or on social media, it is reasonable to conclude certain things about their relationship. For example, if a spouse writes something about their partner it makes sense to take their words at face value.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on what Michael Rapaport and his wife post on social media, they seem to get along with one another quite well and share a sense of humor. For example, at one point Rapaport posted a video of him and his wife having fun dancing on Twitter. Throughout the short clip, Rapaport can be seen making contact when his wife until the video ends with her playfully going to slap him while exclaiming “babe”.</p><p>For anyone who doesn’t see the Twitter video clip as proof enough that Kebe Dunn is amused by her husband’s antics, they can rely on Rapaport’s wife’s own words. After all, to celebrate his birthday, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dunn posted a tribute to Rapaport in which she brought up his comedy chops</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The fearless and funny person I know. The most generous. The most complex temperamental sensitive loving creature. Another best friend of mine … One of the reasons I wake up every day smiling is because it’s my birthday, and I couldn’t love him more if it weren’t unhealthy! “</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Michael Rapaport’s Wife, Kebe Dunn</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrqqr8eanKVlopa9sa3PqKmtq12stqexjKScm51dmcKvuoyrnJqknK56tbTIp6KsZZGXvLbAjKGgrGWjmru0sYyonWagpaK8s3s%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-michael-rappaport-s-wife-kebe-dunn-really-thinks-about-his-sense-of-humor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-michael-rappaport-s-wife-kebe-dunn-really-thinks-about-his-sense-of-humor.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-michael-rappaport-s-wife-kebe-dunn-really-thinks-about-his-sense-of-humor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-michael-rappaport-s-wife-kebe-dunn-really-thinks-about-his-sense-of-humor.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-michael-rappaport-s-wife-kebe-dunn-really-thinks-about-his-sense-of-humor.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-michael-rappaport-s-wife-kebe-dunn-really-thinks-about-his-sense-of-humor.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-phaedra-parks-dating-relationship-timeline-after-split-with-husband-apollo-nida.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-phaedra-parks-dating-relationship-timeline-after-split-with-husband-apollo-nida.html>Who Is Phaedra Parks Dating?
