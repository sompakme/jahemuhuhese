But this could harm the former actress in the long term. "The publisher knows that people would be dying of curiosity to see what she might reveal,” Ross explained.</p><p>"Keeping her comments on the royal family to a minimum would probably benefit her in the long run, but publishers probably want her to reveal a bigger more juicy gossip because that is what really sells,” she continued.</p><p>“I think she will struggle to balance what is best for her and her image, and what the publishers want to sell,” Ross added.</p><h2 id=meghan-markle-rsquo-s-memoir-will-likely-discuss-the-royal-family>Meghan Markle’s Memoir Will Likely Discuss The Royal Family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/meghan-markles-and-her-husband-prince-harry-attending-the-2022-ripple-of-hope-awards.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was originally reported in January that Meghan was in talks to write a memoir, the same month that Harry’s Spare hit bookshelves, which delved into his complicated relationship with his royal family as well as his upbringing. “[Meghan is] contemplating getting entirely candid about her time in the Royal limelight — and leaving no stone unturned,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source said to Daily Mail at the time</a>.</p><p>“I would find it surprising if Meghan didn’t publish her own story, to be honest,” a Hollywood agent told the outlet this week. “‘Spare’ is clearly Prince Harry’s chance to tell his, but hers is equally compelling.

She made her debut in the world of children's literature with the release of her book, The Bench last year. In 2021, Harry and Meghan inked a lucrative contract with Penguin Random House, committing to deliver four more books in the future.</p><p>Meghan’s memoir comes after Spotify pulled the plug on her and Harry’s million-dollar media deal.
