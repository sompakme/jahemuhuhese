<time>25 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Jabari Smith Jr. is an American basketball player who was born to Taneskia Purnell, his mother, and Jabari Smith Sr., his father, who was a former NBA player.</p><p>He competes for the National Basketball Association(NBA) Houston Rockets. The youthful basketball player represented the Auburn Tigers in college, where he was an All-American.</p><p>The Houston Rockets took Smith with the third overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft. He turned down scholarships from Tennessee, Georgia, LSU, Georgia Tech, and North Carolina to play collegiate basketball for Auburn on October 9, 2020.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jabari-smith-jr-parents-the-nba-draft-third-overall-makes-father-jabari-sr-and-mother-taneskia-proud></span>Jabari Smith Jr Parents: The NBA Draft Third Overall Makes Father Jabari Sr And Mother Taneskia Proud<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jabari Smith Jr., a forward from Auburn University, was taken by Houston with the third overall pick, and his parents are extremely proud of him. His father, Jabari Sr, and mother, Taneski, are happier than ever.</p><p>While Houston Rockets awaited their pick in the NBA draft for 2022, they were in a win scenario. In the NCAA Tournament, he was able to assist Auburn in earning a No. 2 seed, but they fell to Miami in the second round.</p><p>Before being chosen by the Sacramento Kings in the second round of the 2000 NBA draft, his father, Jabari Smith Sr., played college basketball at Louisiana State University, as reported by&nbsp;The Focus.</p><p>The senior Smith, a center who stood 6 feet 11 inches tall and shot very well for his size, was renowned for making jump shots from all angles. He represented the Kings, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the New Jersey Nets throughout his NBA career.</p><p>Likewise, his mom Taneskia works for New York Life Insurance Company as a life insurance agent. She would emphasize the value of always being present and living in the moment.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-jabari-smith-jr-family-and-siblings></span>Meet Jabari Smith Jr Family And Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jabari Smith Jr. was born into a native Atlanta-based African-American family. He has an older brother named A.J. Freeman, with whom he grew up playing basketball.</p><p>Since his early years, the young athlete has always been a nice kid. His parents provided him and his sibling with plenty of freedom to pursue their own interests.</p><p>The young boys continued to be passionate and eager to simply mature. Besides, Smith Jr. is one of the best talents in the 2022 draft class and is likely to go in one of the first rounds.</p><p>At Sandy Creek High School in Tyrone, Georgia, Smith first participated in varsity basketball as a freshman. He had a 24.5 point, 10.8 rebounds, and 2.8 blocks per game average as a junior, according to his&nbsp;Wikipedia&nbsp;profile.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jabari-smith-happy-at-huston></span>Jabari Smith Happy At Huston<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jabari Smith Jr., a forward from Auburn University, was chosen by Houston. The majority of mock drafts had him going first overall to the Magic, so when his name wasn’t shouted, it fueled the flame that already exists inside the 19-year-old.</p><p>Yahoo Sports&nbsp;has stated that the 6-10 forward led the Tigers in scoring with 16.9 points per game while shooting 42 percent of his 3-point attempts for the season. He ruled the SEC.</p><p>He will play in Houston alongside Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr., and second-year center Alperen Sengun in a dynamic and explosive unit. The native of Georgia is aware of the Rockets’ ongoing rebuilding phase.</p><p>For the second consecutive season, Houston had the worst record in the NBA. However, Jabari has his sights set on earning Rookie of the Year for the 2022–2023 season and making the postseason in the team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKaSlnqlvsCfq2asmJ6%2FpXnOr5yrmZyhequtwZqpomWjora1tIyjqWalkaCytHnFmquhnaJit6KuwKugZquiYq6vsIympq2glad6ta3NnqqkoZFivbO71J1ka2c%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnba-draft-third-overall-jabari-smith-jr-makes-father-jabari-sr-and-mother-taneskia-proud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnba-draft-third-overall-jabari-smith-jr-makes-father-jabari-sr-and-mother-taneskia-proud.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnba-draft-third-overall-jabari-smith-jr-makes-father-jabari-sr-and-mother-taneskia-proud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnba-draft-third-overall-jabari-smith-jr-makes-father-jabari-sr-and-mother-taneskia-proud.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnba-draft-third-overall-jabari-smith-jr-makes-father-jabari-sr-and-mother-taneskia-proud.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnba-draft-third-overall-jabari-smith-jr-makes-father-jabari-sr-and-mother-taneskia-proud.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./paul-rudd-through-the-years-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./paul-rudd-through-the-years-photos.html>Paul Rudd Through the Years: Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./joe-alwyn-changed-his-relationship-to-his-dating-life-after-breaking-up-with-taylor-swift.html>Joe Alwyn Changed His Relationship To His Dating Life After Breaking Up With Taylor Swift</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./joe-alwyn-changed-his-relationship-to-his-dating-life-after-breaking-up-with-taylor-swift.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
