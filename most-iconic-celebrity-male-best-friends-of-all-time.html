From actors to television personalities to music icons and many more, here are some of the best bromances the showbiz business has ever seen!</p><h2 id=andy-cohen-and-anderson-cooper><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Andy Cohen And Anderson Cooper</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You’d think the similarities between Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper don’t go beyond both men being on your TV screens and sharing identical initials, right? Wrong! they are actually what many would call two peas in a pod. First set up on a blind date in the early '90s, Cohen and Cooper have nurtured <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a friendship spanning over two decades</a>. Even more impressive about these two best friends is how they have been by each other's sides over the years. The pair's incredible bond has also been recently strengthened by their roles as new fathers. Great friends, great co-workers, and doting fathers are just a few of the highlights of these TV gods' friendship. Such BFF goals!</p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio-and-tobey-mcguire><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Leonardo DiCaprio And Tobey McGuire</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sharing the big screen as buddies in the 2013 movie, The Great Gabsy does not even begin to scratch the surface of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the-30-year long friendship shared between Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire</a>. The pair first met as young actors at an audition in the late '80s and have since remained friends. From working together to partying together and becoming neighbors at some point, there’s no breaking the special bond between DiCaprio and Maguire. Not even the warped Hollywood fame can try. In a world where Celebrity friendships crash and burn even before taking off, Leonardo and Tobey’s friendship is sure a model for the upcoming ones.</p><h2 id=adam-levine-and-blake-shelton><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Adam Levine And Blake Shelton</span></h2><p>It is quite unclear when singers Adam Levine and Blake Shelton first met but the duo's adorable friendship went public during their time as judges on NBC's The Voice. Though Adam left the show after season 16, that has not gotten in the way of his bromance with Blake. Most significant about their friendship is the speculation that it was Adam who introduced Blake to his now-wife Gwen Stefani who also serves as a judge on The Voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-hemsworth-and-tom-hiddleston><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Chris Hemsworth And Tom Hiddleston</span></h2><p>Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston may play your favorite MCU characters but these two are definitely more than just co-actors. Since first meeting on the set of Thor in 2009, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris and Tom have become the best of friends</a>, giving Hollywood one of its finest bromances. When they are not acting together, Chris and Tom never fail to support and celebrate each other's achievements and that is something we definitely do love to see! They also share enthusiasm for the same kind of movies and are also super supportive of each other’s achievements. We love to see it!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cutest Friendship Tattoos To Get With Your BFF</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ben-affleck-and-matt-damon><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ben Affleck And Matt Damon</span></h2><p>Ben Affleck reportedly met Matt Damon in the early ’80s when they were just 8 and 10 years old respectively, meaning they have been friends for decades. In their years as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best friends</a>, these two have risen to the top of their careers with Affleck widely known for his role as Batman and Damon popular for portraying Jason Bourne in the Bourne movie franchise. On multiple occasions, the two friends have worked together and each time, you can expect them to bring the magic.</p><h2 id=kevin-hart-and-dwayne-johnson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kevin Hart And Dwayne Johnson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kevin Hart's friendship with WWE star turned actor Dwayne Johnson is not your everyday kind of friendship. But that's what we love about these two; very different yet so alike in a lot of ways. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The duo's bromance</a> started while filming the 2016 comedy action flick, Central Intelligence and from there, they have been literally inseparable. Since releasing Central Intelligence, Dwayne and Kevin have worked on many more movies, including the 2017 blockbuster Jumanji. But while we love this duo's on-screen chemistry, what we can't get enough of is their endless banter both in movies and real life.</p><h2 id=jason-momoa-and-henry-cavil><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jason Momoa And Henry Cavil</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Justice League co-stars Jason Momoa and Henry Cavill ride really hard for each other. From Jason defending each other publicly and giving bear hugs when they can, Jason and Henry have warmed our hearts with their incredible friendship. Despite their seemingly busy schedules, it is not uncommon to find these two hanging out and making memories. Permit us to say we want what these two have!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Unconventional Celebrity Friendships We Can't Ignore</a></span></p><h2 id=vin-diesel-and-paul-walker><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Vin Diesel And Paul Walker</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paul Walker passed away in a tragic car crash in 2013 but his friendship with Vin Diesel is one we will always remember. The pair struck a friendship after they were cast for the original Fast and Furious movie in 2001 and in the years that followed, they gave us a glimpse of what true bromance looks like. Following Walker's untimely death, Diesel has continued to find ways to honor his friend. In 2017,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the actor announced that he named his newborn daughter Pauline</a>, admitting that it was a way to keep Walker's memory alive. Even better, he has remained very close to Walker's daughter Meadow whom he now considers family.</p><h2 id=mel-brooks-and-carl-reiner><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mel Brooks And Carl Reiner</span></h2><p>The year was 1950. Carl Reiner met Mel Brooks and struck what would become one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood's longest-lasting friendships</a>. Seventy years together and Mel and Carl have given us the blueprint of true platonic love. Up until Carl's recent death at the age of 98, the pair often spent their evenings together, eating dinner and watching their favorite shows. We have seen many beautiful friendships but we've quite not seen anything like Mel and Carl's. And we and many others love every bit of it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class="related-single next-single">Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 'Friends' Quotes About Friendship That You Can Share With Your BFF</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikqKukYraku82immablaGyo77IrbBmpZGhsm6uxKyrZp6inrKvsNJmpp9lkaG5bsDIppxo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmost-iconic-celebrity-male-best-friends-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmost-iconic-celebrity-male-best-friends-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmost-iconic-celebrity-male-best-friends-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmost-iconic-celebrity-male-best-friends-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmost-iconic-celebrity-male-best-friends-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmost-iconic-celebrity-male-best-friends-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-life-and-murder-of-nicole-brown-simpson-recap-episodes-1-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-life-and-murder-of-nicole-brown-simpson-recap-episodes-1-2.html>The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson Recap: Episodes 1, 2</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mercy-johnson-biography-net-worth-children-husband.html>Mercy Johnson Biography; Net Worth, Children, Husband</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mercy-johnson-biography-net-worth-children-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
