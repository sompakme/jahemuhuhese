Roberts, like his fellow cast members, was a young adult scrambling to find his footing in the world at a time when reality TV had not become part of the everyday American lexicon. However, unlike other house guests, Roberts was also grappling with surviving in a world that blatantly forbid him to express his sexuality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Roberts skyrocketed to fame at a time when LGBTQ persons were becoming more visible in Hollywood, he was certainly one of his kind. Danny’s wholesome personality and confident sexuality gradually won over his predominantly young adult and teenage audience, transforming him into a revered gay icon. Danny’s stint on reality TV ended when The Real World: New Orleans wrapped production in May 2000. Here’s everything we know about his life after The Real World.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'The Real World: Key West': Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><h2 id=where-does-danny-roberts-live><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Where Does Danny Roberts Live?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danny Roberts and his six-year-old daughter, Naiya Sage, live in a rustic cabin nestled in the lustrous Green Mountains of southern Vermont.
