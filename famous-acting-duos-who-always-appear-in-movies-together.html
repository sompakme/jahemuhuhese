So we've rented them,</a>" Amy Poehler, who'd become TV's most beloved sisters with Tina Fey, told Glamour in 2015 about their friendship and professional relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How James Franco Ruined A Quiet Neighbourhood With His Move</a></span></p><p>Other than Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, there are some other really genuine Hollywood friendships: <strong><a href=#>Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson</a></strong> and Kevin Hart, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill, James Franco and Seth Rogen, and more. They say friends who act in films together, stay together - so to sum it up, here are pairs of actors who always collaborate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-franco---seth-rogen><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>James Franco - Seth Rogen</span></h2><p>James Franco and Seth Rogen are a godly pair of a comedic duo. They'd shared the stage since the 1990s in Freaks & Geeks, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Pineapple Express, Funny People, The Interview, and more. However, their relationship was strained following the long-lasting sexual assault allegations against Franco, and it seems like the bromance won't recover anytime soon.</p><p>"We aren’t working together right now, and we don’t have any plans to work together. Of course, it was hurtful in context, but I get it, you know, he had to answer for me because I was silent," Franco <a href=#>broke his silence</a> in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristen-stewart---jesse-eisenberg><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kristen Stewart - Jesse Eisenberg</span></h2><p>Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg are not your regular acting soulmates. Their chemistry has been proven from time to time, with big box office hits like the likes of Adventureland in 2009, American Ultra in 2015, and Cafe Society in 2016.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I'm not embarrassed around him, ever. He's a really, really, open, warm person.</a> He's a good actor," Steward said of her co-star, adding, "I've known him for years, so to play someone so outside of myself was easy with him because I could do anything and not ever feel silly."</p><h2 id=matt-damon---ben-affleck><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Matt Damon - Ben Affleck</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ben Affleck and Matt Damon go all the way back to the 1980s when they were kids after their mothers introduced them to each other. They acted together as extras in 1989's Field of Dreams and would attend auditions together in the early 1990s. Now, decades later, they will work together once again in an upcoming film on <a href=#>Nike's quest to sign Michael Jordan</a>. Affleck will play the company's co-founder Phil Knight while Damon will star as Sonny Vaccaro.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are James Franco And Seth Rogen Still Friends?</a></span></p><h2 id=chris-evans---scarlett-johansson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chris Evans - Scarlett Johansson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before they were superheroes, Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson kicked off their acting career as teen heartthrobs. They go all the way back to 2004, when they starred in a teen comedy-heist film called The Perfect Score. At the time, Johansson, who was 20, had already been quite famous while Evans was just climbing her way up to acting respect. Fast-forward to the late 2010s, they are responsible for some of the biggest, highest-grossing films of all time.</p><h2 id=ben-stiller---owen-wilson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ben Stiller - Owen Wilson</span></h2><p>While Hollywood can be a hostile place for friendships, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson's bond is just too strong to be separated. The lifelong friends starred for the first time together in Jim Carrey's The Cable Guy in 1996, followed by 1998's Permanent Midnight. They put their on-screen chemistry to test once again in Zoolander, Meet the Parents, and the Night at the Museum franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About James Franco And Seth Rogen's Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=jonah-hill---leonardo-dicaprio><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jonah Hill - Leonardo DiCaprio</span></h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill are two acting geniuses in their own respective well-known genres: drama and comedy. However, when they linked up for Django Unchained in 2012, many fans wondered how their relationship will translate into the film. It wasn't until 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street that fans got their first-ever taste of DiCaprio and Hill's on and off-screen chemistry. Their last project together, Don't Look Up, was released in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio---kate-winslet><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Leonardo DiCaprio - Kate Winslet</span></h2><p>1997's Titanic sees DiCaprio, who was 22 at the time, partnering up with Kate Winslet as two ill-fated lovers during the chaotic night of the Titanic sinking.

They've co-starred in plenty of films, most notably in the Jumanji series and Central Intelligence.
