Despite the <a href=#>initial backlash on casting her as Wednesday Addams</a> in <a href=#>Tim Burton's series, Wednesday</a>, the actress definitely gave justice to <a href=#>the role that was popularized by Christina Ricci</a> — who also <a href=#>plays the viillain, Marilyn Thornhill</a> in the new <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> hit.Now, with memes about Ortega as <a href=#>Pete Davidson's next target</a>, fans can't help but be curious about <a href=#>the You star</a>'s love life. Here's a closer look at her relationship history.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jenna Ortega Says Latina Representation In Netflix's Wednesday Matters</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenna-ortega-has-reportedly-dated-six-guys-in-the-past>Jenna Ortega Has Reportedly 'Dated Six Guys' In The Past</h2><p>In 2018, Ortega was linked to Shazam star, Asher Angel. On Halloween that year, they dressed up as Davidson and his then-girlfriend, <strong><a href=#>Ariana Grande</a></strong>.</p><p>However, neither of them confirmed that they were together. During a live-stream back then, Angel answered "yes" when asked if he had a girlfriend, but quickly clarified, "I mean no, I don't. Sorry guys, kind of tired."</p><p>Before that, The Fallout actress was also linked to singer Jacob Sartorius after appearing in his Chapstick music video. The two also denied the dating rumors and said that they were just "friends." The latter went on to date <a href=#>Stranger Things star, Millie Bobby Brown</a> for nine months.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, Ortega finally set the record straight about her love life during an appearance on the Just Between Us podcast. When asked about the craziest gossip she's heard about herself, she said: "Probably relationships. According to the internet, I dated like six guys, [but I] dated none of them."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Was The First Wednesday Addams: 8 Details About Lisa Loring's Life (Including Why She Quit Hollywood)</a></span></p><h2 id=is-jenna-ortega-dating-anyone-in-2022>Is Jenna Ortega Dating Anyone In 2022?</h2><p>Ortega is currently single. But recently, her reaction to seeing a flag (as seen in the clip below) sparked rumors... "me thinking i have a chance with jenna ortega just bc she smiled at a lesbian flag," wrote a Twitter user. Fans also recalled the actress tweeting "Lesbian rights ;)" back in July 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with TV Insider, Ortega also referred to her co-star, Gwendoline Christie as her wife. "My lady," she said about <a href=#>the Game of Thrones star</a> at that time. "I cherish you. I apologize if it comes across as disrespectful, but it is the name I give her. She's my wife, after all. I'm sorry; my heart breaks whenever I look at you." Christie has been dating British fashion designer, Giles Deacon since 2013.</p><p>Though Ortega hasn't set the record straight on the speculations, she certainly thinks her character is a queer icon. When asked why, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Gayety</a>: "I think because she's a badass. She's cool, she's got a nice sense of style, but she's somebody who embraces her differences and isn't out to please anybody. I feel like that's a really, really powerful thing to see. I feel like people want to see powerful women with powerful women."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Emma Myers Is Nothing Like Her Enid Sinclair Character On Wednesday</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenna-ortega-is-concerned-about-wednesday-s-love-triangle>Jenna Ortega Is Concerned About Wednesday's Love Triangle</h2><p>Ortega isn't crazy about Wednesday's relationship drama. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to ETalk</a>, she said she "had to accept" it — before protesting: "Well, no, honestly, I'm gonna fight this love triangle thing so hard. Because it's just me being protective. Because I don't think Wednesday would ever be in a love triangle. And I talked to the writers about this, and they said, 'Don't worry, don't worry. It's not gonna be that, it's not gonna be that.'"</p><p>The 20-year-old actress added that it's "important" that any relationship should be "strictly out of pleasure, or amusement, rather than severe interest or being boy-crazy in some sense. Because honestly, I think boys are probably the last thing on Wednesday's mind." And many viewers agree (though <a href=#>some find the show "annoying"</a>). "Wednesday is so badass," tweeted a fan. "We need more role models like her for our littles."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ortega previously told MTV News</a> that she's "always been against the love triangle idea," but clarified that she sees a different potential in Wednesday and Xavier's relationship. "I think there's an opportunity there for a really sweet platonic relationship," she explained. "Because I don't think it's shown often enough: men and women having safe, platonic relationships that don't become romantic and are just genuine, almost sibling-like relationships."</p><p>We can't wait to see how it plays out in season 2. Unfortunately, as of this writing, Netflix hasn't confirmed a renewal yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuw8SdpZ6rlJbGtHnJnqWnmV2kv7WxxppknZmknruoec2ormg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-wednesday-s-jenna-ortega-dating-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-wednesday-s-jenna-ortega-dating-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-wednesday-s-jenna-ortega-dating-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-wednesday-s-jenna-ortega-dating-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-wednesday-s-jenna-ortega-dating-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-wednesday-s-jenna-ortega-dating-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amelia-hamlin-why-i-got-breast-reduction-surgery-at-16.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amelia-hamlin-why-i-got-breast-reduction-surgery-at-16.html>Amelia Hamlin: Why I Got Breast Reduction Surgery at 16</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-truth-about-90-day-fiance-star-ed-s-net-worth.html>The Truth About 90 Day Fiance Star Eds Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-truth-about-90-day-fiance-star-ed-s-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
