<time>09 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It’s here! After many teases of the dramatics to come, the explosive Real Housewives of Beverly Hills reunion has finally begun! And, quelle surprise, the first part of RHOBH’s reunion brought the drama. In the March 31 installment alone, Housewives accused each other of being <a href=# rel=noopener>bitches, anorexics, liars, and attention whores</a> — among other things — as they discussed topics ranging from <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Brandi Glanville</strong></a>’s alcohol use, the Richards sisters’ feud, and the Amsterdam joke slap.</p><p>So, which Bravo Housewife finished off the first round of the reunion on top? Only our RHOBH episodic power rankings can tell you for sure!</p><p><strong>1. Yolanda Foster</strong></p><p>If any Housewife has ever deserved a medal just for participating in a reunion, it is Yolanda Foster. Considering that her Lyme disease has relapsed so badly that she can’t read, write, or watch television, it would have been easy for Foster to excuse herself from a day filled with mercurial drama. Still, she stuck it out for a little while to talk about her current health struggles, update everyone on how her daughters are doing, and discuss why she stayed friends with Glanville when everyone else has turned against her. It was a calm outing for Foster in general, but one that is admirable given her current circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Best Moment: </strong>Yolanda peaced out of the reunion by telling Cohen she needed to go to bed. It was not a glamorous exit, but it was wonderfully to the point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/yolanda-foster-eileen-davidson-RHOBH1-lg.jpg><p><strong>2. Lisa Rinna</strong></p><p>So far, so good for Rinna! All she had to do tonight was defend her hustling attitude and explain why she was so skinny this season (answer: she was stressed about her parents). She did both of these things with aplomb and also was able to keep her trademark good humor about everything.</p><p><strong>Best Moment:</strong> Rinna announced that she made more than $1 million for a Depends commercial, which proved to everyone that she is a hustler whom we all can admire. Later on, she told <strong>Kim Richards</strong> that she would never do Diving with the Stars like she did, which proved to everyone that she also is a master shade-thrower.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Lisa Vanderpump</strong></p><p>Vanderpump spent the first part of the reunion justifying her cold stance toward Glanville, saying she was still burned by what Glanville did to her during season 4 and wasn’t willing to risk getting close again. It was the same argument she has made over and over again throughout the season, but it was a solid one and she managed to keep her cool when Glanville’s digs got cattier and cattier. At this point, Vanderpump is a reunion pro and it was obvious throughout the episode. Plus, her purple dress was fantastic.</p><p><strong>Best Moment:</strong> While arguing with Glanville over whether or not the former friend had a fling with her son’s 23-year-old BFF in Amsterdam, Vanderpump busted out a hilarious Dutch accent as she tried to impersonate Glanville’s young paramour. One only hopes that Vanderpump will have the opportunity to badly imitate many other accents in future reunion installments.</p><p><strong>4. Kim Richards</strong></p><p>Richards started off the reunion in high spirits and it was kind of — dare we say? — likable. She talked about booking acting gigs and defended her continuing friendship with Glanville, and generally was a happy, perky version of herself. Dark waters brewed, though, as part one of the reunion hinted at the growing tension with both her sister and with Rinna.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Best Moment:</strong> Richards may or may not have confirmed that she will be involved with Sharknado 3 early on in the reunion. If anyone can protect the United States from an incoming shark invasion, it is Richards, who proved in Amsterdam that she can deliver a beatdown like the best of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/brandi-glanville-RHOBH1-lg.jpg><p><strong>5. <a href=# rel=noopener>Kyle Richards</a></strong></p><p>It was a quiet episode for Richards this time around, too. She defended Vanderpump’s stance on Glanville and made a few digs toward Glanville’s public drunkenness, but that was about it. However, based on the glimpses we saw of the current Richards sisterly dynamic, <a href=# rel=noopener>which Us Weekly revealed ahead of the reunion premiere</a>, it looks like things are about to get really gnarly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Best Moment: </strong>Even though she didn’t say much this time around, Richards definitely brought it when it came to wardrobe. Her red, long-sleeved dress, bold lipstick, and simple diamond <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> came together to create one of her hottest looks yet!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. Eileen Davidson</strong></p><p>Davidson did not bring much to this opening part of the reunion. She commented on Glanville’s drunken tendencies and made a few jokes about her husband, but it was a quiet installment all around. Will Davidson’s inner soap diva rise to the surface? Only time will tell.</p><p><strong>Best Moment:</strong> When Davidson admitted that it was her husband who was peeking through the garage window in the background of the Poker Night drama with the Richards sisters and Glanville all those months ago. It confirmed one of the funniest moments of the season for eagle-eyed superfans, and gave less diehard viewers a reason to watch those episodes again.</p><p><strong>7. Brandi Glanville</strong></p><p>With everyone attacking everything from Glanville’s drunken shenanigans to her antics with Vanderpump, Glanville was this week’s punching bag and she did not like it one bit. She tried defending herself in myriad ways, ranging from calm arguments to throwing around below-the-belt insults, but none of the other Housewives, save for her bestie Kim Richards, were buying it. At one point, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> even compared her to a rogue puppy who always goes too far! You know things are bad when even the supposed impartial host of the reunion is digging at you, and based on this installment, things are going bad for Glanville.</p><p><strong>Best Moment:</strong> At one point Kyle Richards tried to shame Glanville’s public drunkenness by bringing up the time when she was caught by paparazzi with her tampon string hanging out of her dress. In typical Glanville fashion, she quickly countered with, “at least I still get my period, bitch!” Sure, the comment was far from classy, but it was very entertaining, and that’s why we all love our Housewives.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The RHOBH reunion continues at 8 p.m. on April 7 and 14 on Bravo.</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Which Housewife do you think came out on top during the first part of the reunion?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmemZxitbDB0p6uoq6VqHqwsoybnK%2BdoqHGbrTIpaOsZaKawq%2B1zqdkq52Tlr1uuMismGaaopa7pbWMm6Oor12qvW5%2Bj2psbGljZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2freal-housewives-of-beverly-hills-reunion-recap-lisa-brandi-blow-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2freal-housewives-of-beverly-hills-reunion-recap-lisa-brandi-blow-up.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2freal-housewives-of-beverly-hills-reunion-recap-lisa-brandi-blow-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2freal-housewives-of-beverly-hills-reunion-recap-lisa-brandi-blow-up.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2freal-housewives-of-beverly-hills-reunion-recap-lisa-brandi-blow-up.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2freal-housewives-of-beverly-hills-reunion-recap-lisa-brandi-blow-up.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ricky-bell-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ricky-bell-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Ricky Bell Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./matt-barnes-ex-wife-gloria-govan-wikipedia-age-sister-net-worth-birthday-husband-kids-parent.html>Matt Barnes Ex-Wife: Gloria Govan Wikipedia, Age, Sister, Net Worth, Birthday, Husband, Kids, Parent</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./matt-barnes-ex-wife-gloria-govan-wikipedia-age-sister-net-worth-birthday-husband-kids-parent.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
