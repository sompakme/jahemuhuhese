For Costner, it was a messy divorce happening all over again. Just like in his first marriage and divorce, the star actor's young children with Baumgartner had to watch their once-stable two-parent home fall apart.</p><p>The Hidden Figures star and fashion designer's divorce proceedings made headlines for several weeks as they went back and forth in court over divorce settlement and child support issues. It is safe to say that when divorces happen, kids are not left out of the drama that could ensue. Even stars like <a href=#>Taylor Swift can attest to the effect of parental divorce</a>. With the dynamics in the couple's union, Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner's kids had to adjust to major changes. Here's a look at their new normal after the pair's marriage fell apart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-39-s-children-after-their-divorce>What Happened To Kevin Costner And Christine Baumgartner's Children After Their Divorce?</h2><p>From prenuptial arrangement issues to child support and legal fees, Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner dragged off their messy divorce for several months. Amid all of these, the former couple's teenage children had to adjust to the structure put in place after their parents went back and forth in court. At several points amid their divorce drama, the kids came up regarding their fate in all of these.</p><p>Christine Baumgartner, a fashion designer, filed for divorce in May, citing irreconcilable differences. One month later, she accused Kevin Costner of blindsiding the children by informing them of the divorce without her presence. In court documents obtained by People, the mom-of-three claimed that her ex-husband made a 10-minute call with the children via Zoom to inform them of the state of their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar51344605.png><p>She bemoaned the state of things, relaying that she feared that her children would find out about their divorce from an outside source. Due to this fear, Baumgartner noted that she suggested that she and the Yellowstone actor put up a united front to inform the children of their split. She stated, "I am still confused by his motivation to do this via a very short Zoom session, especially since he was planning on being some five days later."</p><p>By July 2023, Kevin Costner filed a motion for <a href=#>Christine Baumgartner to vacate their $145 million Santa Barbara mansion</a>. The handbag designer was instructed by the court to leave the abode by the end of the month. This was in line with the couple's 2004 prenuptial arrangement, which stated that she had to vacate their abode within 30 days of filing for divorce. According to DailyMail, regarding this, she accused her ex-spouse of trying to make her and the children homeless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-kids-pic-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kevin Costner Almost Divorced Christine Baumgartner Decades Before Their Contentious 2023 Separation, Here's Why</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner had a falling out long before their highly publicized and scandalous 2023 separation.</span><p>However, it is safe to say that Cayden and his siblings did not suffer in terms of luxury while their parents went head-to-head in court. While Baumgartner was asked to leave the luxury home, the kids lived with their father at his Colorado home known as Dunbar Ranch. The former model moved into a $40,000-per-month rental home in Montecito, and the kids also spent time there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kevin-costner-s-ex-wife-claims-he-d-throw-wild-christmas-parties-as-she-tries-to-negotiate-bigger-divorce-settlement.jpg><p>Amid all of these, it appeared like the WaterWorld actor's relationship with the children went on fine. A few days before his ex-wife was expected to move out of the 10-acre family house, Kevin Costner and the kids were spotted in Aspen. According to DailyMail, it was the first time they reunited after Baumgartner filed for divorce. The Bodyguard actor picked up his kids at a local airport before they went grocery shopping, and from the whole scenery, it appeared they were at ease.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the back and forth over child support payment, Kevin Costner was ordered to pay Baumgartner a temporary $129,755 per month as opposed to her $248,000 request. She would later file for the payment to be increased to $175,057. On September 1, 2023, the embattled couple was issued the final verdict concerning their dramatic child support issue. The Santa Barbara Judge presiding over the case ruled in favor of Costner as a huge slash was implemented on the temporary child support payment initially issued. He was ordered to pay $63,209 per month.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/have-the-lives-of-kevin-costner-s-children-changed-forever-after-his-divorce-from-christine-baumgartner_-front-back-_-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kevin Costner’s Ex-Wife Claims He’d Throw Wild Christmas Parties As She Tries To Negotiate Bigger Divorce Settlement</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>She says their kids are used to a luxurious lifestyle, so she needs more child support to give it to them.</span><p>One day after the hearing, the actor was seen hanging out with the couple's youngest son, Hayes. Per DailyMail, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the father-son duo looked relaxed as they enjoyed breakfast</a> at a Santa Barbara restaurant. As reported by the New York Post, the verdict also stated that both parents would be responsible for the kids' private school tuition and extracurricular activities.

As reported by The List, Cayden, Hayes, and Grace spend time with both parents, from time to time, in luxury. They have access to Kevin Costner's beach house in Carpinteria, California, which is perched atop a cliff flanking the Pacific Ocean. When they spend time with Christine Baumgartner, the kids have access to a jacuzzi, a bocce ball court, and a beach. While Cayden already owns a boat, Hayes will be making his foray into Hollywood in their Dad's 2024 flick Horizon.</p><p><strong>A look through some of Kevin Costner's payments amid his divorce from Christine Baumgartner, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>:</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Kevin Costner paid C</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>ristine Baumgartner 1.45 million, as stated in the prenup.</strong></li><li><strong>Kevin Costner paid Christine Baumgartner $10,000 for her moving cost.</strong></li><li><strong>Kevin Costner made attorney fees and forensic payments wit a sum of $300,000.</strong></li><li><strong>Kevin Costner was initially placed on a $129,755 child support payment per month.</strong></li></ul><h2 id=how-did-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-reach-their-divorce-settlement>How Did Kevin Costner And Christine Baumgartner Reach Their Divorce Settlement?</h2><p>Kevin Costner's child support battle with Christine Baumgartner came with a lot of back and forth, but their divorce finalization followed almost immediately. This was due to the prenuptial arrangement put in place when they first got married. Per the documents from the decades-long arrangement, <a href=#>Costner was to pay his ex-wife $1 million</a> when she filed for divorce, which he did.</p><p>According to Us Weekly, Christine Baumgartner, however, kicked against it, noting that the money was deposited into an account created in her name without her consent. She alleged that her former husband made the payment, so she could "tap into this money, so he can argue that I've waived my right to challenge the premarital arrangement."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another contentious aspect of the former partner's divorce was when Kevin Costner asked Christine Baumgartner to exit their Santa Barbara mansion. According to documents obtained by TMZ, the TV star stated that she refused to leave the abode despite the moving costs he provided. Baumgartner countered him by stating that the cost of rentals in California requires her to take time to find a new place.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Was Christine Baumgartner Spending Just As Over The Top As Kevin Costner's Before Their Contentious Divorce?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Christine Baumgartner didn't exactly hold back when it came to spending Kevin Costner's eye-watering $250 million net worth.</span><p>She temporarily moved into a guest house on the property, but Costner accused her of trying to loot his home. The judge declined Baumgartner's request to stay longer in the mansion, as she eventually left by the end of July.</p><p>Christine Baumgartner and Kevin Costner's messy divorce ultimately reached a resolution in September. The details of the settlement were not immediately revealed. Per TMZ, the fashion creator signed a three-page settlement letter over the weekend. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A representative for both parties told the LA Times</a> in a joint statement:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Kevin and Christine Costner have come to an amicable and mutually agreed upon resolution of all issues pertaining to their divorce proceedings."</p><p>Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner were together for over 20 years and married for 18 before ending their union. The pair first met in the mid-90s but did not start dating until 1999. This was when he was married to his first wife, Cindy Silva.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinq6Zo3qku9KtpZ6qo2KwqbXLnamepl2Ws7Wx0Waboq6fp7CmecWrpqZlk52%2Fqr%2FToqWeZZKWwq6zwKurp52iZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhave-the-lives-of-kevin-costner-s-children-changed-forever-after-his-divorce-from-christine-baumgart.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhave-the-lives-of-kevin-costner-s-children-changed-forever-after-his-divorce-from-christine-baumgart.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhave-the-lives-of-kevin-costner-s-children-changed-forever-after-his-divorce-from-christine-baumgart.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhave-the-lives-of-kevin-costner-s-children-changed-forever-after-his-divorce-from-christine-baumgart.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhave-the-lives-of-kevin-costner-s-children-changed-forever-after-his-divorce-from-christine-baumgart.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhave-the-lives-of-kevin-costner-s-children-changed-forever-after-his-divorce-from-christine-baumgart.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./here-s-how-armie-hammer-managed-to-keep-this-role-amid-his-scandal.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./here-s-how-armie-hammer-managed-to-keep-this-role-amid-his-scandal.html>Here's How Armie Hammer Managed To Keep This Role Amid His Scandal</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./don-henley-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Don Henley Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./don-henley-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
