Was it her lover or someone else who was sleeping at the house? Let’s investigate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Police Investigation Met A Dead End</h2><p>Wyatt called 911 and was treated by paramedics after discovering him bleeding from wounds to his head and face.</p><p>He revealed to the cops that he had recently reconnected with Yolanda while chatting with them.&nbsp;</p><p>He claimed that Yolanda’s conversation with someone on the phone was what initially roused him.&nbsp;</p><p>He then heard the gunfire. He attempted to tackle the man, which is how he was hurt, but the man got away. No fingerprints were found. There was blood everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Yolanda’s blood was only found in the bedroom; according to the blood evidence found in the apartment, Wyatt’s blood was found elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>There were no witnesses to the gunfire as police searched the building. Qaw’mane, who Wood also spoke with, claimed he was unaware that his mother had resumed her relationship with Wyatt.</p><p>Wyatt agreed to submit to a polygraph examination, so detectives switched their attention back to him.&nbsp;</p><p>Results showed that he was lying, but because there was no proof linking him to the murder, authorities did not make an arrest at that time.</p><p>Weeks went by with no sign of any fresh leads. In addition to Yolanda’s husband, who was serving a life sentence for a double killing, detectives explored every lead but found nothing conceivable.&nbsp;</p><p>Police thought Yolanda’s murder might be retaliation, but this line of inquiry fizzled out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Phone Records Gave A Lead</h2><p>It took a year before phone records gave them a concrete lead. The detectives discovered Yolanda had two phones.&nbsp;</p><p>They soon discovered that the phone number Qaw’mane gave the cops was Yolanda’s second registered phone number.&nbsp;</p><p>When Spencer entered Yolanda’s building the night of the murder, Qaw’mane acknowledged that he knew him from the area and named him the culprit.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Killed Yolanda Holmes, & Why?</h2><p>Then Qaw’mane revealed to the investigators that it was only planned to be a heist when Spencer went to his mother’s building.</p><p>He wanted her life insurance policy, <a href=#>business</a>, and car because he was unemployed and his career as a rapper had hit a wall.&nbsp;</p><p>According to nbcchicago.com, Qaw’mane took roughly $70,000 out of his dead mother’s accounts after her passing and spent it on expensive clothing and vehicles.</p><p>Qaw’mane Wilson was taken into custody on December 24, 2013, for the murder of his mother. He was convicted of first-degree murder in January 2020 and given a 99-year jail term.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDFzqWYp5yRYrWwuMyeqmalpaexpr6O</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fyolanda-holmes-murder-how-was-she-killed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fyolanda-holmes-murder-how-was-she-killed.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fyolanda-holmes-murder-how-was-she-killed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fyolanda-holmes-murder-how-was-she-killed.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fyolanda-holmes-murder-how-was-she-killed.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fyolanda-holmes-murder-how-was-she-killed.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./12-signs-you-re-definitely-not-ready-to-be-a-parent.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./12-signs-you-re-definitely-not-ready-to-be-a-parent.html>12 Signs You're DEFINITELY Not Ready To Be A Parent</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-elosanta-on-twitch-meet-the-streamer-on-instagram.html>Who Is Elosanta On Twitch?
