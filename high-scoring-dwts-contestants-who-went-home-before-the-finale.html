The show received so much backlash that they changed the way celebrities are booted from the show; they let the judges decide who goes home in between the two couples with the lowest combined score and fan votes.

She was so beloved and fans were so disappointed when she left the show too early that they invited her back as a guest performer one week.</p><h2 id=melora-hardin-was-voted-off-dancing-with-the-stars><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Melora Hardin Was Voted Off Dancing With the Stars</span></h2><p>Definitely a fan favorite as well as a judge's favorite on season 30 of Dancing With the Stars, The Office and The Bold Type star, Melora Hardin, was voted off just before the finale.
