If Russian curse words were a&nbsp;person with arms and&nbsp;legs, he would be dancing for&nbsp;joy right now. The&nbsp;art of&nbsp;swearing has won a&nbsp;peculiar victory: The&nbsp;State Duma has officially recognized it as a&nbsp;threat, a&nbsp;foe of&nbsp;Russian civilization and&nbsp;a cancerous tumor in&nbsp;the healthy body of&nbsp;Russian culture.</p><p>The&nbsp;authorities have bestowed a&nbsp;high honor on&nbsp;the four most graphic of&nbsp;all Slavic expletives by&nbsp;banning them from&nbsp;use in&nbsp;works of&nbsp;art. This is tantamount to&nbsp;officials admitting that the&nbsp;offensive words are stronger than they are and&nbsp;that the&nbsp;expletives carry an&nbsp;energy transcending their own will.</p><p>Cursing has become nothing more than a&nbsp;casual expression of&nbsp;displeasure.<br></p><p>But who is it exactly that fears language? Pagans consumed by&nbsp;the dark magic of&nbsp;the words, Russian Orthodox opponents of&nbsp;nontraditional sexual orientations and&nbsp;those who glorify authoritarianism while they quietly become totalitarian leaders&nbsp;— only they are capable of&nbsp;waging this ridiculous battle for&nbsp;absolute control of&nbsp;the language.</p><p>It so obviously stupid to&nbsp;ban offensive words. Swear words ceased being meaningful in&nbsp;France once they were freely incorporated into&nbsp;French literature in&nbsp;the 18th century. Now the&nbsp;people of&nbsp;France are truly at&nbsp;a loss to&nbsp;find French equivalents for&nbsp;Russian expletives. Invective lasted longer in&nbsp;the German and&nbsp;English languages, but indifferent attitudes toward cursing robbed it of&nbsp;its force in&nbsp;the last third of&nbsp;the 20th century. That indifference has been the&nbsp;ultimate undoing of&nbsp;foul language.</p><p>Cursing has also been on&nbsp;the decline in&nbsp;the Russian language too. It has become increasingly rare to&nbsp;hear foul language on&nbsp;the streets of&nbsp;Moscow and&nbsp;other Russian cities. The&nbsp;words have lost their sharp, provocative appeal and&nbsp;lately only appear as individual expletives scrawled on&nbsp;the walls and&nbsp;fences of&nbsp;provincial towns.</p><p>We already witnessed the&nbsp;final convulsions of&nbsp;cursing when it emerged from&nbsp;the dark and&nbsp;forbidding forest into&nbsp;the light of&nbsp;day to&nbsp;become nothing more than a&nbsp;casual expression of&nbsp;displeasure or frustration. The&nbsp;innocuous "damn," which my atheist grandmother was ironically afraid to&nbsp;utter, disappeared in&nbsp;the 1960s but reappeared in&nbsp;the mid-1990s, when beautiful Muscovite ladies took it up as a&nbsp;fashionable way to&nbsp;complain about a&nbsp;flat tire or a&nbsp;broken eyeliner pencil.</p><p>Cursing has transformed from&nbsp;a language expressing hatred to&nbsp;a kinder and&nbsp;gentler collection of&nbsp;interjections and&nbsp;rhetorical demands. It has lost its original function, reverting into&nbsp;</p><p>simple vulgarisms.</p><p>But what is swearing? Is it a&nbsp;word or an&nbsp;action, a&nbsp;mere combination of&nbsp;sounds or a&nbsp;vehement curse?</p><p>If using expletives in&nbsp;their original meaning, the&nbsp;language of&nbsp;hatred can become the&nbsp;language of&nbsp;love. With rare exceptions, Russian obscenities never refer to&nbsp;fecal matter&nbsp;— unlike the&nbsp;swear words of&nbsp;most European languages.</p><p>Russian expletives can be purely erotic, and&nbsp;the most progressive of&nbsp;today's youth are very adept at&nbsp;this application of&nbsp;the medium. The&nbsp;authorities would have a&nbsp;tough time banning that form of&nbsp;cursing. In&nbsp;fact, over time, the&nbsp;meaning of&nbsp;swear words has taken on&nbsp;a purely "localized" character.</p><p>The&nbsp;truly abusive form of&nbsp;invective is mainly used in&nbsp;prisons, dysfunctional families and&nbsp;by those classes of&nbsp;society that once staged the&nbsp;October Revolution. In&nbsp;fact, those three classes often intersect. When a&nbsp;child grows up in&nbsp;a dysfunctional family in&nbsp;which a&nbsp;drunken father curses wildly while he beats his wife and&nbsp;causes the&nbsp;baby to&nbsp;cry in&nbsp;terror, swearing becomes anathema by&nbsp;association. If such a&nbsp;child goes on&nbsp;to become a&nbsp;teacher, doctor, athlete or public official, he will fiercely hate foul language because of&nbsp;the ugliness of&nbsp;his childhood.</p><p>Generally, the&nbsp;first generation of&nbsp;people to&nbsp;rise above their low beginnings&nbsp;— the&nbsp;bourgeois, in&nbsp;the old and&nbsp;positive sense of&nbsp;the word&nbsp;— despises its roots and&nbsp;tries in&nbsp;every way possible to&nbsp;distinguish itself from&nbsp;the masses. The&nbsp;State Duma, largely consisting of&nbsp;such respected personages, has expressed this inherent aspiration by&nbsp;condemning the&nbsp;use of&nbsp;obscenities.</p><p>Russia's aristocrats, merchants and&nbsp;accomplished people generally hold a&nbsp;completely different attitude toward swearing.</p><p>Filmmaker Nikita Mikhalkov, with whom I am rarely in&nbsp;agreement, correctly defended the&nbsp;right to&nbsp;use obscenities. The&nbsp;occasional expletive clearly did not play a&nbsp;harmful role in&nbsp;his upbringing.</p><p>To&nbsp;the contrary, in&nbsp;Russian aristocratic culture from&nbsp;Ivan Barkov to&nbsp;the Silver Age, obscenities were used as a&nbsp;diversion and&nbsp;a plaything. Western as well as more "nativist" Russian writers valued the&nbsp;natural strength and&nbsp;expressiveness of&nbsp;Russian expletives. Russian obscenities allow for&nbsp;the multiplication of&nbsp;contradictory meanings and&nbsp;reveal the&nbsp;mobility and&nbsp;morphological flexibility of&nbsp;the Russian language. Its expletives are concise and&nbsp;yet expansive, concrete and&nbsp;also very abstract.</p><p>Fyodor Dostoevsky wrote eloquently of&nbsp;Russian curse words in&nbsp;his "Diary of&nbsp;a Writer," Alexander Pushkin used them in&nbsp;his humorous verse and&nbsp;they were no strangers to&nbsp;the poetry, prose and&nbsp;letters of&nbsp;Ivan Turgenev, Anton Chekhov, Vasily Rozanov, Vladimir Mayakovsky and&nbsp;Sergei Yesenin&nbsp;— in&nbsp;short, all who knew the&nbsp;power of&nbsp;the Russian language.</p><p>The&nbsp;ban on&nbsp;cursing only reinforces its use as an&nbsp;expression of&nbsp;anger and&nbsp;hatred, though. And&nbsp;in our day, when the&nbsp;echoes of&nbsp;war are no longer empty metaphors but full of&nbsp;terrible meaning, the&nbsp;aggressive language of&nbsp;swearing becomes the&nbsp;domain not of&nbsp;the "unwashed masses" but of&nbsp;commanders and&nbsp;even state leaders bent on&nbsp;conquest.</p><p>Victor Erofeyev is a&nbsp;Russian writer whose autobiographical novel "Good Stalin" was recently published in&nbsp;English.
