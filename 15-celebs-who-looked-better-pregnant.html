I can't quite put my finger on it, but seeing women carrying a baby is extremely hot. Could it be that it's the ultimate sign of fertility? After all, there's no surer sign that a woman is able to bear children than a swollen belly. It shows that she's able to conceive, and that is an alarm bell for men that she can carry your offspring. Or at least that's how I explain my strange fetish to myself. But it's not just me - as a matter of fact it's not just men either. Many women attest to&nbsp;feeling much sexier while they're carrying children. They also say their sex drive goes through the roof, which is good news for the fathers of those children! There's also an undeniable "glow" that women have when they're pregnant - they seem to radiate a certain sense of pure bliss that is undeniably attractive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If women seem hotter when they're pregnant, then pregnant celebrities are the hottest women on earth. Female celebs are already usually incredibly attractive - most of them are models, actresses, or simply very sexy individuals. So when they get knocked up, that inherent hotness gets multiplied exponentially, and suddenly they become jaw-dropping sex icons. And most female celebrities go through a stage of being pregnant, many of them more than once. After all, most people want to start a family at some point in their&nbsp;life, and the maternal instinct can be very strong. Therefore, all of your favorite hot celebrities have probably been pregnant once before. So sit back, relax, and get ready for 15 of the hottest pregnant celebrities that ever got knocked up. Just try not to get jealous of the guys who put those babies in there...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p>First up on the list is the name that's hot on everyone's lips, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a>. I love the way she looks pregnant. She was always pretty curvy, but the addition of a bun in the oven makes her nice and thick. An added benefit of being pregnant is that women's boobs tend to grow and swell a little bit, which I'm sure <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West</a> enjoyed thoroughly. She looks like she's really glowing in these pictures as well, a symptom no doubt caused by the happiness and bliss of being pregnant and succumbing to one of the greatest urges that women ever feel. Some say giving birth is the most important thing a woman can do in life.</p><p>Even though she looks pretty happy, she says it wasn't as great as she thought: "For me, pregnancy is the worst experience of my life! LOL! I don't enjoy one moment of it and I don't understand people who enjoy it. My mom [<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris Jenner</a>] and Kourtney clearly did! More power to them but I just don't relate!&nbsp;It is all SO worth it when you have your precious baby in the end!" she says. "So for all my complaining, it's 100 percent worth it and more!!!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chrissy-teigen><strong>Chrissy Teigen&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It's pretty satisfying seeing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrissy Teigen</a> with her belly all swollen like a balloon. She was sexy enough before she got pregnant, but seeing her body completely ravaged by the process of pregnancy is somehow a huge turn on.</p><p>Speaking about her pregnancy, she admitted that she loved the feeling of being knocked up, confessing: "I would definitely adopt or have foster children. But I loved being pregnant. Maybe I should be scared [of having PPD again], but I don't know. It couldn't be any worse than it was - could it?" She then continued, "It's a beautiful thing. We want to have a few more hopefully. Three or four. We'll play it by ear though."</p><p>On another occasion, she said: “I felt unfit all the time before. It’s nice to relax and feel like you don’t need a six-pack,” the cookbook author says. “I truly embrace this body. I think I might be happier pregnant. I love it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-hudson><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kate Hudson</a> is another celebrity that looked pretty damn hot when she was completely pregnant. This might be due to the fact that she's a pretty small girl, so to see her body stretched beyond all logical proportions as it tries to fit a growing baby inside of her is somehow a huge turn on, at least for me. She's also such a hot babe even without a bun in the oven, and I love the way her face positively glows with the satisfaction of knowing she's fulfilling a major purpose in her life.</p><p>But don't take my word for it, Kate Hudson herself admitted that she loved&nbsp;the feeling of her belly swelling up with her child:&nbsp;“I loved it too — I relished in that moment of my [life]. I had this Christmas party and I don’t know what I was thinking — I put on a size 2, like, spandex Versace dress. I was two weeks away from having Ryder — I must’ve been 200 lbs. And I wore these white Ugg boots and this dress, and I was so happy.&nbsp;And I open the door [to the party] and I was like, ‘Merry Christmas!’ and there was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Stiller</a>. And he just started to laugh. And he was like, ‘Oh my God, you’re huge.’ ”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued: “Even my doctor was like, ‘You know, you should try not to eat so much. And then after I had Ryder, that was when it sort of hit me … and then, trying to lose the weight and being in that year of my life was really interesting, ’cause then all of a sudden you have the baby and then all of a sudden you’re 70 lbs. overweight.”</p><h2 id=jessica-alba><strong>Jessica Alba&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Alba</a> is undeniably one of the sexiest women alive, so it makes total sense that her pregnant body was just as hot, perhaps even more. I always thought that if there was one thing wrong with Jessica Alba, it was that she was a tad too skinny for my tastes. But after her baby bump started to swell, she started really fill out, and she looked more like a "real woman." It's also pretty clear that her boobs got a lot bigger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking about pregnancy, she played down the sex factor, saying: “I just don’t associate being pregnant with being sexy." But then she later posed this question on a talk show: "As someone who's in the later stage of pregnancy, is there any way to harm the baby during intercourse?" Obviously she was thinking a lot about sex while she was pregnant.</p><p>She also said: "I think being pregnant is grounding and you feel like part of the earth and connected with women. It’s not a sex thing to me. It’s a grounding, maternal thing.”</p><p>On another occasion, she admitted: “I was much more stressed and concerned about my body before I had kids.&nbsp;But now I know how silly and unimportant it is, so it’s certainly given me perspective.&nbsp;Being pregnant and giving birth gave me a new found respect for my body, it’s amazing.&nbsp;It made me realize: ‘Oh right, this is why we have all the bits that we have!’ There is a real reason for it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=natalie-portman><strong>Natalie Portman</strong></h2><p>Whoops! Looks like someone forgot to take their birth control! Just kidding, I'm sure that this baby was not an accident. But the look on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natalie Portman</a>'s face in the photo on the left is pretty uncomfortable... She looks like she's really struggling with the fact that her belly is&nbsp;huge. And that's not an understatement. They say that some women carry their babies really well, and Natalie Portman is obviously not one of them. Her belly has swollen to almost comical proportions, and she doesn't seem too happy about it. Whether her frustrated expression is a result of regret, forgetting her birth control, or just plain frustration at being the size of a hot air balloon, I guess we'll never know.</p><p>She confirmed that she's not to happy about her knocked up look on the red carpet when she said: "It does make you look forward to the day when you can just have your own body on the red carpet."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She complained about her huge size again when she said: “Everyone thinks I’m about to pop and about to give birth any minute, and I have MONTHS to go.” Even people at the grocery store are commenting on her appearance. “I went to the store the other day to buy water and the guy at the checkout counter was like, ‘Almost, huh?’ I was like, ‘No! Not at all!'”</p><h2 id=britney-spears><strong>Britney Spears&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears</a> is another female celebrity that totally rocked her pregnant look. Let's be honest, Britney rocks pretty much&nbsp;any&nbsp;look, and she's always been hot. But there's something pretty exciting about seeing a girl like Britney knocked up. A lot of us have grown up with her, and we've seen her since she was just a young teen trying to make it in the music industry. That's why it's so satisfying to see her with a swollen belly, because she's finally thrown off the guise of a naughty little girl, and she's become the mother that nature always intended her to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although, she was still quite naughty even when she was carrying her child, as she admitted:&nbsp;"Because I'm pregnant, I'm big, and I don't really want to get out that much. I go to his closet and just bleach everything." Britney has proven herself to be a great mom, and today she's one of the world's hottest MILFs. But I would love to see her knocked up a few more times before she gives it a rest...</p><h2 id=jessica-simpson><strong>Jessica Simpson&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Simpson</a> has always been hot, but something happened to her when she was pregnant that made her utterly insatiable. And she is one of those women who felt like she was destined to be pregnant; like it's her purpose in life: "Pregnancy is meant for me. I could be pregnant forever," She said. "I want to buy the clothes, I want to do the nursery. So when I know, everyone will know, because I have a big mouth."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Jessica Simpson was pregnant with her second child, she joked about getting repeatedly knocked up, and not being able to keep her legs crossed: “We’ve had two separate wedding dates, but he keeps knocking me up. We’re doing it very backwards, I know… I’ll just keep my legs crossed, I guess, this time.”</p><p>She also admitted that her second child was a complete accident, saying: “Apparently it was part of God’s plan for my life. I was extremely shocked because I was going through a lot of hormonal changes, trying to get back to the old, vibrant Jessica. You know, it was like a one-night stand. And it happened, all over again! I was really happy to be pregnant and I didn't ever step on the scale, I didn't realize you could gain that much weight that quickly. I didn't really make any healthy, good decisions."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gisele-bundchen><strong>Gisele Bundchen</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gisele Bundchen</a> was probably one of the hottest women alive at one point, and she still has the body of a model. It seems that even pregnancy couldn't stop her from looking hot, and she totally rocked the pregnant look. She admitted to doing yoga and kung fu while she was pregnant to stop herself from getting too overweight, and it looked like that tactic worked pretty well.</p><p>She raised a lot of controversy when she started talking about how she stayed so fit while she was pregnant, and at the same time blasting other moms who let themselves go while pregnant: “I think a lot of people get pregnant and decide they can turn into garbage disposals. I was mindful about what I ate, and I gained only 30 pounds.”</p><p>She also sparked outrage when she blasted moms who don't breastfeed, saying: ''Some people here (in the US) think they don't have to breastfeed, and I think 'Are you going to give chemical food to your child when they are so little?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-fox><strong>Megan Fox</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan Fox</a> is another female celebrity who looked incredibly hot while pregnant. I think many guys have a huge fantasy about knocking this gorgeous lady up, and staring at the pictures, it's possible to pretend that you were the one to put that baby in her belly, at least for a moment. That's what makes these pictures so hot. There's also the fact that she looks incredible, even while she's not pregnant, so that hotness carries on into the time when she was with child. Her boobs look like they've inflated a couple sizes, and she manages to look disheveled and beautiful at the same time.</p><p>And Megan Fox has revealed that she absolutely loves getting knocked up:&nbsp;“I feel great. I love being pregnant. A lot of women don’t feel that way—[pregnancy] is really uncomfortable. It is painful at parts, but I feel the overall process is an amazing one. I feel so productive creating a human person that I’m so excited to meet because I know that I have such a spiritual connection to them. I can’t wait to meet this new member of my family.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=candice-swanepoel><strong>Candice Swanepoel&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Candice Swanepoel</a> is another model who managed to get herself knocked up, and she might just be the sexiest pregnant woman ever. Of course, she was pretty sexy when she didn't have that baby bump, but something about seeing her waddle around with that giant stomach is a huge turn on. She's a girl that tons of people became obsessed with as she rose to fame as a Victoria's Secret model, so I guess it was only a matter of time before some guy came along and put a bun in her oven.</p><p>I love that she managed to take some artful sexy pictures of herself while pregnant, as it shows off just how hot a woman can look while being pregnant. Everyone got really excited when she announced her pregnancy, especially Swanepoel herself, who took to Instagram to announce her coming child, saying in Portuguese&nbsp;something along the lines of&nbsp;"What happens now, large belly, baby angel?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=imogen-thomas><strong>Imogen Thomas</strong></h2><p>Imogen Thomas is a former Big Brother&nbsp;contestant who became famous after her affair with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Giggs</a> was exposed. It seemed the maternal urge to get knocked up was strong with this one, as she admitted before getting pregnant:&nbsp;"I want to start trying in January for the New Year. I don't want to scare Adam away but I'm really broody right now.&nbsp;I keep seeing lots of friends around me being pregnant and it makes me want another one!"</p><p>She also talked about how hard it was to watch her diet: "I can’t stop eating potatoes and cheese and I want chicken curry with rice all the time, even when I wake up. I eat crisps and chocolate when Adam isn’t here because I know I’m being a pig. I’m putting a lot of crap in my mouth!"</p><p>But in the end, she said being pregnant has transformed her life: “I never thought I would find happiness again but finding love then falling pregnant has transformed my life. Adam has started getting excited now I’m showing — he keeps touching the bump. It is amazing to think our baby is inside there.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hayden-panettiere><strong>Hayden Panettiere&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Hayden Panettiere</a> is another fan-favorite who I'm sure a lot of guys out there delighted in seeing knocked up with a nice, big swollen belly. Actually the word "big" might just be an understatement. That belly is huge! Judging by the size of her, you might think that she was pregnant with twins, even triplets. But the fact is that Hayden is only pregnant with one - a girl.</p><p>She herself expressed concern at just how big her belly was getting, saying: "I'm 5 feet, 2 inches and I started out at 106 pounds and guess how much I weight now? Around 145 pounds.&nbsp;And the worst part is that my feet are still size five and they're going, ''What's going on with all this weight?'' They're about to snap from underneath me with the strain.&nbsp;I'm still quite muscular, so if you're running around carrying 40 pounds of extra weight, you're going to build extra muscle. I'll tell you one thing for sure, I am not walking down the aisle 40 pounds heavier than usual in a wedding dress with a huge pregnancy belly stitched in. Not happening."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alessandra-ambrosio><strong>Alessandra Ambrosio</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alessandra Ambrosio</a> was one of my favorite models of all time growing up, and she's definitely someone I fantasized a lot about. Like a lot of the top models these days, she hails from Brazil. Her and Adriana Lima had somewhat of a rivalry, although I was always on team Alessandra! Since her modeling days, she's done a lot of growing up, and now as you can see she's become a proud mother. She looks amazingly hot while pregnant, and the only thing I hate about these images is that I wasn't the one to put that baby in her!</p><p>Like a lot of models, she had to regain her body if she wanted to keep her job after giving birth: "I only had three months to lose all the weight," She said, "And I was on this 1,200-calorie-a-day meal-delivery service that I hated. I couldn’t do that again.&nbsp;In my family, no one ever worked out. It wasn’t until I did my first Victoria’s Secret show that I started exercising.&nbsp;Now that it’s a healthy, normal part of my daily routine, my kids will grow up seeing it in the same way, and I love that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She actually loves her post-pregnancy body, as she revealed: "Your body will never go back to exactly what it was before pregnancy, whatever people tell you. It can’t.&nbsp;But I think I have a better body now than before I had kids. It’s partly because I work out, whereas before I didn’t, but also to do with the shape – it just looks more formed now, and I feel better about it than I did."</p><h2 id=heidi-klum><strong>Heidi Klum</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heidi Klum</a> is one of the most famous models in the world, if not&nbsp;the&nbsp;most famous. Since her days on the catwalk, she's matured a lot, and embraced her role as a mother. But it's always a treat to see her all knocked up, and she's now on her fourth child!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A veteran mom such as herself knew right away that she was pregnant a fourth time, saying: “Yeah, I kind of knew. You feel your body change and I’ve done it three times before. Then I got the proof from the doctor and it was wonderful. Seal had the biggest smile. He said, ‘Here we go, one more time!’ Because all this time, we’ve said, ‘Okay, one more and that’s it.’ We said that after Leni and Henry. When Johan was born, I still didn’t feel like I was done. When we looked around the table, it was like one person was missing. So we’ve been, you know, having fun as a couple. And that’s how No. 4 came about. But that will be it.”</p><p>When asked if she enjoyed being pregnant, she answered honestly: “I do. It’s the most wonderful thing that your body goes through. It’s producing another human being! What a miracle. It’s never boring. Not old hat like, ‘Oh, I’ve done it three times.’ Every time is a new first time and I love it. Then the birth is just an amazing experience.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shakira><strong>Shakira</strong></h2><p>They say her hips don't lie, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakira</a>'s hips must have been killing her under the immense weight of her baby. She's actually had 2 children so far, but is excited to have many more, saying: "I would love to have eight or nine kids with Gerard—my own fútbol team. When you have a baby, when you feel his love, you feel so at peace with the world. You just want to share the good news and share how happy you feel."</p><p>It would be quite the sight to see Shakira with 8 or 9 kids! But it's almost certain that her body would become almost completely ravaged and destroyed as a result. She probably wouldn't be dancing with as much enthusiasm after she had given birth to an entire "futbol team" as she puts it. But who knows. There are some women who are no doubt strong enough to handle that much stress. And I'm sure her husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerard Pique</a>, wouldn't complain!
