Over the course of her six-year profession, Danica Patrick participated in 191 races, the first and last both being Daytona 500s on the Daytona International Speedway. She started the same way she ended: with finesse and impressive statistics. In her time, she achieved high praise for her notable talent and accomplishments as the top-scoring female racer. Her skill set is remarkable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She won a race during the Indy Japan 300 back in 2008, which was a magnificent feat for not only her pride but for women drivers in general. A female racer had yet to place first in any race within the IndyCar Series...until Danica Patrick sealed the deal. She is the prime role model for adolescent girls and adult-age women for her stellar ability to exceed beyond the mundane and not let an industry of mostly males deter her from reaching excellence.</p><p>She shone brighter than the sun in the NASCAR spotlight. Everyone knows Danica Patrick as the representative face of women in NASCAR, so the end of her racing career prompts questions about what she will do with all her time, off of the track. Well, the misconstrued belief is that Danica’s life revolved around racing and nothing else. The reality is that the professional racing legend transcends in everything that she does. Here are 20 images that prove Danica Patrick does not need NASCAR in order to live a fulfilling and abundant life, with plenty of happiness and prosperity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-does-not-need-nascar-race-cars-to-flaunt-her-driving-skills>Danica Does Not Need NASCAR Race Cars to Flaunt Her Driving Skills</h2><p>Danica Patrick owns a commercial car just like you and me. That’s right, she doesn’t drive a No. 7 GoDaddy Chevrolet race car in her everyday life. She walked away from her beloved race car after being involved in a seven-vehicle car crash during her final race on February 18th of this year. While the specifics of the car, like its brand or model, are unclear, it is evident that Danica will not be missing out on her passion for driving. She can be seen pictured in the driver’s seat of a motor vehicle that emulates a camper in many aspects. Is she preparing to embark on a camping trip? Is she exchanging her low-level, two-door, electric green Lightning McQueen for a much larger and passenger-friendly car? Who’s to say! The fact is that not racing for NASCAR anymore frees up plenty of time for her to devote toward adventure. Instead of going round and round on a racetrack, Danica Patrick can now venture out and exploring other roads.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-can-wear-whatever-she-wants-and-flaunt-her-personal-style-now>Danica Can Wear Whatever She Wants and Flaunt Her Personal Style Now</h2><p>NASCAR drivers wear tight-fitting multi-colored outfits with a lot of Velcro and elastic stitching all throughout the get up. One huge perk of not driving for NASCAR anymore is that Danica is now free from the restraints of a jumpsuit. Most racing suits are embellished with slogans and branding galore. She no longer has to strut her stuff like a walking advertisement and that is such a relief for anyone who has a certain stylistic approach to their wardrobe. Based on the attire Danica Patrick is photographed in off the racetrack, she has the cutest array of tops and bottoms. We cannot wait to see more of her chic and trendy style. She is always beautiful, whether she's adorning a racing suit or wearing the latest elegant evening gowns, but I'm stoked to see more of her casual wear. Danica doesn’t need NASCAR to dress her anymore. She can assemble her own outfits and strike a pose in the limelight. Talk about a fashion icon!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-spends-more-time-relaxing-and-unwinding-after-saying-goodbye-to-nascar>Danica Spends More Time Relaxing and Unwinding After Saying Goodbye to NASCAR</h2><p>When racing against fellow race legends, Patrick had to exert thousands of hours every year to honing her driving abilities. With her life centralized around improving her speed and bettering her slight left turns, there was not much time left in her chaotic schedule to focus on other aspects of her life. Now, the days she dedicated to practicing her skills and tricks on the race course are not completely free of that responsibility. Now, I cannot say that I know for a fact what it is that Danica Patrick does to fill her days, but I can only imagine that she is living her best life, as we should all strive to do. Danica serves as an inspiration in yet another regard. Switching up her career is not an end, but merely the beginning of something different and exhilarating. Danica is definitely one who opts for adventure and enthralling experiences, so I bet she's just as excited as we are to figure out where her life path will lead her next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=instead-of-racing-around-the-tracks-danica-watches-races-and-analyzes-results>Instead of Racing Around the Tracks, Danica Watches Races and Analyzes Results</h2><p>Danica Patrick has said toodle loo to playing the sport she came to know and love, but just because she no longer races does not mean she must forget about the sport in entirety. Like baseball superstars who become spokespeople for Major League Baseball, or former linemen who eventually find careers as football commentators, Danica Patrick could always pursue a job as an announcer for NASCAR or any of the major race events. The wonderful silver lining in her bode farewell to the sport is that it does not have to be an eternal goodbye. Danica does not need to stay with NASCAR in order to keep in touch with the passion that has been so deeply a part of her life all these years. Now, instead of being tied to contracts and feeling like she has to keep up with the racing lifestyle, she can involve herself as much or as little as she prefers. Leaving NASCAR allows Danica Patrick to have more of a voice in her decisions and that's something everyone deserves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-patrick-is-also-a-model>Danica Patrick Is Also a&nbsp;Model</h2><p>Former race car speedster Danica Patrick is not only gifted in the racing industry. She also modeled on the side throughout the duration of her career. I commend her for channeling her own energy and pursuing other channels on the side of her NASCAR fame. Maybe now that she is no longer restricted by the very demanding lifestyle of professional athleticism, she swapped her heavy race suit for a dainty swimsuit. Danica Patrick might just start teaming up with brands and promoting products she believes in, too! You never know, but anything is possible for a woman of all talents, and that’s surely what Danica Patrick represents. I don’t even wear bikinis because the sun rarely shines in my neighborhood, and when it does, a breeze accompanies the warm rays. Surely not swim suit weather, but even then, her promotion of the black bikini has me convinced that I need one, too. Danica never fails to impress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-patrick-finds-new-ways-to-exercise-and-stay-in-shape>Danica Patrick Finds New Ways to Exercise and Stay in Shape</h2><p>Danica Patrick is an athletic goddess. While she is very clearly known for her racing abilities and utter talent, Patrick has found joy in other forms of exercise. The photo above depicts Patrick jogging on the streets during a race. In this case, it was by way of foot, not car. In numerous interviews, Danica Patrick has responded to the claim that she must work out all the time to stay as in shape as she always is, and as it turns out, she makes it a priority to stay active. No need to worry about Danica and her source of physical activity. A naturally active and physically fit gal like her will always find a way to move around. If you really consider the scenario, sitting in a race car and figuring out how to surpass the competition is more of a mental work-out than a test of physical endurance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-patricks-has-a-love-interest-and-it-is-not-nascar>Danica Patricks Has a Love Interest And It Is Not NASCAR</h2><p>Danica recently fell head over heels for the American quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, who currently plays for the Green Bay Packers. Love is in the air for these two athletes. They have been together for a few months now, but their friendship dates back to 2012, just over six years ago. They inevitably met through their professions and spotted each other at events over the years. For a while there, Patrick and Rodgers were in committed relationships. When Patrick split from her boyfriend of five years, Ricky Steinhouse Jr., Rodgers was a recently single man himself after ending his relationship with Olivia Munn. As they interacted more and learned more about each other's habits, they uncovered a wealth of similarities. From there, they threw caution to the wind and decided to take another shot at love and, well, so far, so good! The duo share the experiences of life as professional athletes, allowing them to uphold and support one another in a very special way. Sorry, NASCAR. Patrick's one true love may just be Aaron Rodgers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-patrick-looks-to-rock-climbing-to-fulfill-her-love-for-thrills>Danica Patrick Looks to Rock Climbing to Fulfill Her Love For Thrills</h2><p>You may wonder how someone so acclimated to living life on the edge and diving into somewhat life-threatening experiences willingly could possibly adjust to a simple life. I have that same fascinating inquiry floating around in my mind, too. Does Danica ever miss the fast pace and live action of race days? How does she satisfy the edge that keeps her adrenaline pumping? Well, she rock climbs and boulders! That's how! Dangling from the side of a rock wall with only a few grips in arms' reach and a stretchy rope preventing&nbsp; you from falling&nbsp;to the ground&nbsp;are the only preventative measures for keeping people safe as they climb great heights. For some, that is a terrifying and daunting idea to grasp, one that keeps them from ever scaling the side of a rock wall in the first place. For daredevils like Danica Patrick, however, this opportunity is just what she craves. She can still get that rush from endorphins and neurotransmitters involved in fight or flight responses, even off the race track.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leaving-nascar-leaves-more-room-for-self-care>Leaving NASCAR Leaves More Room For Self-Care</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In her newfound down time, Danica can focus more of her energy inwards, focusing on her flexibility - both physically and mentally - as she makes room for more yoga in her life. As someone who spent her NASCAR career primarily seated in a confined position during races, Danica knows all too well the importance of stretching your body and allowing your muscles the time to heal, as needed. Listening to your body when it craves water or desperately yearns for relaxation are two examples of mindfulness. Racing along speedways is not a calming undertaking by any means. Danica needs time to recuperate her mind and soul after years of constant go, go, go. Her life is now in a place that allows for a slow pace and a laid back nature. After all the hype, stress, and forward motion caused by racing professionally, Danica deserves to unwind and chill. Without NASCAR in her line of sight, she is able to adapt to a more serene day-to-day lifestyle. Doesn't that sound like a dream?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-is-still-the-star-in-a-crowd-full-of-male-athletes>Danica Is Still the Star in a Crowd Full Of Male Athletes</h2><p>Danica raced mostly against male drivers, seeing as NASCAR is a competitive industry whose participants consist primarily of men. That said, she has grown very acquainted with groups of people where an imbalance in gender is present. She stands her ground very well and does not for a second appear to be intimidated in the slightest. She shouldn’t be, either. She has as much ability as any male athlete in their division. In a recent filming event for Pacific Coast News, Danica Patrick was photographed with gigantic muscles and veins that seemed ready to pop out from her arms at any moment. Turns out, she was just dawning a very realistic-looking bodysuit with blown-up muscles, but you could have fooled me. In fact, she did until I researched the image furthermore. The point is that, amid a crowd full of people, my eyes zeroed in on her. NASCAR or not, Danica Patrick captivates attention for the person she is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-patrick-s-parents-always-support-her-even-at-the-end-of-her-racing-career>Danica Patrick's Parents Always Support Her, Even at the End of Her Racing Career</h2><p>Now that Danica has raced around the tracks for the last time, she can spend all those hours once exerted towards perfecting turns and acceleration with her family. I can only imagine that her mother, Beverly Ann, and her father, T.J., are over the moon with excitement at the fact that their daughter is no longer zooming in circular movements at high speeds. That sounds like a heart failure waiting to happen, if I have ever heard of one. Her mom and dad have been incredibly encouraging throughout her whole lifetime, even permitting her to withdraw from high school prior to completion, in order to pursue her passions abroad in Europe. That support system heavily contributed to her self-esteem as a racer and belief in herself as an individual. Now that NASCAR is no longer part of her life, Danica can reconnect with her parents and visit them far more often.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=without-nascar-responsibilities-danica-can-spend-more-time-bonding-with-her-sister>Without NASCAR Responsibilities, Danica Can Spend More Time Bonding With Her Sister</h2><p>On the topic of family, Danica has a sister, named Brooke. The two appear to be quite close, sharing a bond that only sisters can understand. Brooke has two young children of her own, pictured in the image above. Family members are the only people who truly know how to rattle your sanity and drive you crazy, but all of that aside, they can also be the most treasured people in your life. Danica and Brooke not only resemble&nbsp;one another in terms of physical appearance, but they seem to find comfort in each other's company. If I had to guess, I would say that Danica and Brooke developed a loving relationship over the years of childhood and now support each other through all courses in life, pun intended. Danica recently wished her sister the warmest of birthday blessings, denoting that their relationship is one that Danica values immensely. NASCAR racer or not, Brooke always has Danica's back. That is pure love at its most wholesome level. I am here for that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=patrick-still-makes-enviable-money-without-nascar>Patrick Still Makes Enviable Money Without NASCAR</h2><p>One of the more unknown fun facts about Danica Patrick is that she is an avid wine enthusiast, with dry white wines being her go-to alcoholic drink of choice. Her passion for fine wine developed into an eventual endeavor of becoming the proprietor of a winery. Located on Howell Mountain in Napa Valley, CA, the Somnium Vineyard is an extensive field of delicious fruit and the producer of magnificent wines. Danica Patrick has the flexibility to devote generous amount of time to this project, now that she no longer has outstanding commitments to NASCAR. Training for races requires that a very solid portion of one's days be spent practicing technique and improving tactics to implement on race days.&nbsp;Running a business is quite the mission in its own right, but tackling entrepreneurship while being a full-time race car driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, she has so much more freedom and time to commit to other projects that spark her interest!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-patrick-doesn-t-need-nascar-in-order-to-positively-influence-other-people>Danica Patrick Doesn't Need NASCAR in Order to Positively Influence Other People</h2><p>From standing out among her male counterparts and not letting a community dominated by men discourage her, Danica Patrick is quite the role model for women of all ages. Representation matters. It is pivotal that we see people who are like us in the media. Seeing the same model time and time again, or being conditioned to believe that only a certain type of person is suitable for a role, creates this false ideology in our minds of what we should be, eventually drawing comparison to who and what we really are. When we do not embody what we're taught we need in order to excel in a particular field, we doubt our abilities and assume that we are unworthy. We accept defeat without ever gaining leverage or momentum necessary to excel. Danica continues to be that person for young girls and aging women: a constant reminder that women can do anything men can do. All you need is perseverance and faith in your talents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-patrick-doesn-t-need-nascar-to-maintain-relevance-and-media-attention>Danica Patrick Doesn't Need NASCAR to Maintain Relevance and Media Attention</h2><p>Danica Patrick is worth paying attention to, on and off the race tracks. She speaks eloquently, discusses subject matter that requires serious insight, and carries herself with great poise. She is not afraid to touch on matters of taboo, like the importance of exercise for mental clarity and the seriousness of never-ending migraines. Danica may notice a reduction in the amount of microphones and news source cameras shoved in her line of vision. She may even come to appreciate fewer press release&nbsp;meetings and run-ins with paparazzi who focus on NASCAR stars. Stepping out of the NASCAR publicity, and allowing herself to decompress as she settles into a life void of racing, may just be what Danica Patrick requires at this point in her life. Being a member of NASCAR was a dream come true for the girl-become-woman with a need for speed, but her interest has run dry and her time is better spent on matters that she deems important. All that matters is her genuine happiness. As long as she feels content, I'm happy for Danica Patrick. Change is good. Let's see where her new path in life travels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6toamBitq6txp6qZqyYlsFuvNGorZ5llJa7qq%2FAZqearKKesKx5w6icrGWepMFuusSem2amkaiwor6MmqWypZ%2BnsnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-images-that-prove-danica-patrick-does-not-need-nascar-anymore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-images-that-prove-danica-patrick-does-not-need-nascar-anymore.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-images-that-prove-danica-patrick-does-not-need-nascar-anymore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-images-that-prove-danica-patrick-does-not-need-nascar-anymore.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-images-that-prove-danica-patrick-does-not-need-nascar-anymore.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-images-that-prove-danica-patrick-does-not-need-nascar-anymore.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bethenny-frankel-shares-untouched-nude-pic-with-us.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bethenny-frankel-shares-untouched-nude-pic-with-us.html>Bethenny Frankel Shares Untouched Nude Pic With Us</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-playboy-magazine-united-states-march-1965-dating-playboy-magazine-united-states-march.html>Who is Playboy Magazine [United States] (March 1965) dating?
