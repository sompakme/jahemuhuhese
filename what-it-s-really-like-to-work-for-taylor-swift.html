Then there are the detractors, exes, people she supposedly has feuded with, and some people who plain just don't like her pretty, skinny white-girl vibe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift</a> can be said to be 30 going on 16. Her whole life revolves around her music and her fans, together with her Squad of beautiful women. Think of her as the most popular girl in your high school and you've just about nailed Taylor Swift.</p><p>But what's it like to work for her? Well, while one or two former assistants have dissed her, mostly it's a case of reading between the lines and getting the measure of the real Taylor Swift. Here's what we think it's like to work for Taylor Swift.</p><h2 id=the-blur-between-her-professional-and-personal-life><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>The Blur Between Her Professional And Personal Life</span></h2><p>From <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Jonas</a> to Calvin Harris to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Tom Hiddleston</a> and back again, Swift has dated a lot of guys. The pattern usually goes something like this: She is all gooey and starry-eyed over a guy for a time, then all of a sudden the chump has the door slammed in his face. Then comes the song about how horrible he was. Life is just fodder for songs for Swift. The staff gets used to it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Many Celebrity Guys Has Taylor Swift Dated?</a></span></p><h2 id=silver-spoon-attitude><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Silver-Spoon Attitude</span></h2><p>Swift was born into an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">affluent Pennsylvania family.</a> Her dad is a stockbroker. She got ferried into New York City on a regular basis for singing and acting lessons. Tennessee? That only entered her life when she set her sights on a country music career and her family moved down to Nashville to facilitate that when she was in her teens. She was a real silver-spoon kid. Expect her to be way entitled.</p><h2 id=good-manners-or-else><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Good Manners Or Else</span></h2><p>There are some people that think Taylor Swift puts on the nice-girl-who-loves-everybody-and-always-says-please-and-thank-you act.&nbsp; If she is, she's got it down pat. We suggest surveying some social media posts by a few exes or Kim Kardashian. The nice-girl thing is part of Taylor's brand. Staff is expected to support that image, please and thank you. Or else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=determination-in-spades><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Determination In Spades</span></h2><p>This is a girl who signed her first record deal before she even had a driving license. And then<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> there is her ability to do splits.</a>&nbsp;Splits? She says:&nbsp;“I was the kid in elementary school who could never do them. So it was a big goal of mine." For 4 months she stretched every day and finally managed to do the perfect split. As she says: “Take that, elementary school insecurities.” Expect someone who knows what she wants and gets it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Evolution Of Taylor Swift, In Photos</a></span></p><h2 id=the-importance-of-the-squad><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The Importance Of The Squad</span></h2><p>Meet The Squad, Swift's hand-pick girl-power chums. Selena Gomez, Gigi Hadid, and Ellie Goulding all made the cut. Think of it like the "in crowd" at school and you get the vibe. Supposedly these rich, mostly skinny women support one another through hard times. You know, like when you put on a pound or your rocker boyfriend dumps you. They all have wonderful things to say about Swift. Of course, they do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=only-pretty-people-need-apply><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Only Pretty People Need Apply</span></h2><p>Rumor has it, supposedly from an ex-assistant, Taylor considers herself so good looking that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she only wants to be around good looking people</a>. Hence The Squad. Tay-Tay likes pretty things only. So, that may mean that if you aren't gorgeous there's no point in applying for a job to work for her. Sorry about that.</p><h2 id=she-s-a-home-body---party-hard-types-go-away><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She's A Home Body - Party Hard Types Go Away</span></h2><p>If you had a $20 million New York City penthouse or a 12,000 square foot Rhode Island beach house, you'd be a homebody too, most likely. Lena Dunham, Swift's bestie actress, writer, director chum says Taylor's idea of a good time on a Saturday is night kicking back with an old movie and a glass of wine. If you party hard, look elsewhere.</p><h2 id=for-swift-it-s-all-or-nothing><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>For Swift, It's All Or Nothing</span></h2><p>As her many, many boyfriends have learned, Swift is an all or nothing kind of girl. She goes from hot to cold in the blink of an eye. Staff can expect to be kept guessing as to whether or not they are in or out. If you're out, it will happen suddenly and without warning. Just ask ex, Calvin Harris.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-ve-got-to-be-p-c><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>You've Got To Be P.C.</span></h2><p>Taylor is currently calling for the removal of racist statues in Tennessee.&nbsp;&nbsp;She describes herself as a feminist who is firmly behind the Black Lives Matter and gun control movements. It will surprise no one that she is pro-choice when it comes to abortions. Right-wingers would do well to stay away from Tay-Tay. Political correctness is required.</p><h2 id=don-t-mention-the-feuds><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Don't Mention The Feuds</span></h2><p>Kim Kardashian called her a liar when Swift denied giving hubby Kanye West permission to use Swift in a song. Nicki Minaj jumped on her skinny white girl's image. And she and Katy Perry competed over hiring dancings and other work crew for their tours. And don't even get into the exes and their woes. Staff can expect to referee social media battles.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift: The Biggest Feuds Explained</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-the-best-people-person-since-bill-clinton><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She's The Best People Person Since Bill Clinton</span></h2><p>The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;has called her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"the best people person since Bill Clinton"</a>. What the heck does that mean? It simply means she meets people well, puts them at their ease, turns on the charm, and makes the most of the photo op the moment presents. Is it real? Who knows. But staff know that it is an important part of the Swift brand. And they know to guard the myth with their lives.</p><h2 id=her-fans-represent-her-best-relationships><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Her Fans Represent Her Best Relationships</span></h2><p>It can be said that Swift's best relationships have been and will be with her fans. Why? Well, look at it this way: With fans, all you have to do is take 5 or 10 minutes, maybe shoot the breeze and take a few selfies and then move on. Just about anybody could be charming, friendly, and sweet for a few minutes. Swift herself has admitted her best relationships are with her fans. Very revealing.</p><h2 id=management-swift-is-largely-d-i-y><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Management? Swift Is Largely D.I.Y.</span></h2><p>Taylor Swift's wealthy parents moved heaven and earth to support her in her ambitions to become a singer/songwriter. But other than that, her so-called "management" is pretty flat to non-existent. Swift makes her own decisions and it has to be said they are almost always good ones. Of course, in the past, she's had big record labels like Sony behind her. That helps. The staff does it her way or no way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sensitive-about-her-body><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sensitive About Her Body</span></h2><p>There have been times when some thought Taylor Swift was way too thin for her own good. At 30-years-old, she seems more body positive and does not pursue the ultra-thin body of her early years. She is not as sensitive about it as she once was, but the staff needs to be careful what they say about the Swift bod.</p><h2 id=led-by-her-heart-not-her-head><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Led By Her Heart, Not Her Head</span></h2><p>If you are looking for a completely rational, logical boss who comes to each and every decision with a cold and calculating eye, Taylor Swift is not your girl. Sure, she has made a big success in her career. But in most things relating to love she is ruled by her heart and not her head. Life with Taylor won't always be peaceful and calm.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Stars Have Said About Taylor Swift (Good And Bad)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra1v4yrnJqknK56rbXKnmStp12svLO3jJ%2Bmq2Wklsatu9FmqrChlql8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-it-s-really-like-to-work-for-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-it-s-really-like-to-work-for-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-it-s-really-like-to-work-for-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-it-s-really-like-to-work-for-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-it-s-really-like-to-work-for-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-it-s-really-like-to-work-for-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./will-there-be-a-stepmother-4-on-tubi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./will-there-be-a-stepmother-4-on-tubi.html>Will There Be A Stepmother 4 On Tubi?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-love-in-the-jungle-a-detailed-look-at-discovery-s-reality-show.html>What Is 'Love In The Jungle'?
