We will never understand why such a talented musician had to be taken so soon; however, we can only hope that something like this never happens again and that we can help those in need before they reach such desperation as Mark must have been feeling. Let us honor him and all he accomplished within his short lifetime.</p><p>On Thursday night, the Nashville Police Department released body-camera footage of the deadly shooting of 54-year-old William Capps in an effort to be transparent.&nbsp;</p><p>The footage is unfortunately inconclusive due to the reflecting sunlight on the glass door surrounding Capps’ home. It is known that Capps was wanted for kidnapping and assaulting his wife and stepdaughter earlier that morning, having threatened to kill them if they alerted anyone of their situation.&nbsp;</p><p>To protect these innocent civilians, Metro police responded and ultimately resorted to lethal force in order to subdue Capps and bring him into custody.</p><p>The incident highlights an unfortunate example of damning criminal behavior yet also presents a very delicate issue with regard to understanding country-wide police use of force standards.</p><p>Two women were allegedly held against their will and subjected to frightening behavior by a man, later identified as record producer Dave Capps.&nbsp;</p><p>The women were able to escape and report the incident to the police after Capps fell asleep around dawn. The SWAT team later confronted and killed Capps after issuing warrants at 1:55 p.m.</p><p>According to his website, Capps has worked with numerous country and gospel artists since 1987, including Alabama, the Dixie Chicks, Neil Diamond, Amy Grant, and others.</p><p>Dave Capps, a record producer and Grammy award-winning artist, was killed by a SWAT team in Nashville after being accused of holding two women against their will and threatening to kill them.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Nashville police spokesperson Don Aaron, the SWAT team was preparing for the possibility that Capps would barricade himself inside his home when he came to the door with a gun in hand and was shot by the officers.&nbsp;</p><p>It was later discovered that Capps had cameras monitoring the outside of his home, and footage of the shooting shows an officer standing outside a glass screen door and yelling “Show me your hands!” before opening fire. Capps’ wife and stepdaughter reportedly told officers that he had threatened to shoot police as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Capps had recently lost his brother and posted about it on his Facebook page before the incident. An investigation will be conducted to confirm that the officers acted properly.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC5wKuiZpuRpb20ec6boK2tkafGcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmark-capps-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmark-capps-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmark-capps-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmark-capps-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmark-capps-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmark-capps-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./over-a-decade-after-lost-aired-are-the-cast-members-still-friends.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./over-a-decade-after-lost-aired-are-the-cast-members-still-friends.html>Over A Decade After Lost Aired, Are The Cast Members Still Friends?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./james-franco-movies-his-10-best-appearances-so-far.html>James Franco Movies: His 10 Best Appearances So Far</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./james-franco-movies-his-10-best-appearances-so-far.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
