The film has received great reviews, particularly for Portman's portrayal of Jane Foster. This article outlines the success of Portman's films, with a number of them bringing in the big bucks. These include franchises such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars, as well as low-budget films such as Cold Mountain that became <a href=#>box office successes</a>. These are the 10 highest-grossing Natalie Portman movies:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=v-for-vendetta-2006---132-5-million>V For Vendetta (2006) - $132.5 Million</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>V for Vendetta was Natalie Portman's first real opportunity to establish herself as an attraction at the movie office, and the film's marketing campaign focused primarily on her role as the protagonist. The story also follows how Portman's character becomes involved in V's mission. V for Vendetta grossed more than twice its costs to end at $132.5 million, becoming a cult classic to this day. Despite the slight controversy surrounding the subject matter, critics generally praised Portman's performance alongside Hugo Weaving's in V, and audiences turned out to see it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-strings-attached-2011---149-2-million>No Strings Attached (2011) - $149.2 Million</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In No Strings Attached, Natalie Portman played against type in a film that ranks among Ivan Reitman's best works. Her debut in romantic comedy was a success, with the picture grossing $149.2 million and receiving accolades for her chemistry with <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a>. Portman's popularity with American moviegoers was demonstrated by the fact that the film grossed 50% of its total revenue in the United States.</p><h2 id=cold-mountain-2003---173-million>Cold Mountain (2003) - $173 Million</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>W.P. Inman, portrayed by Jude Law, is a deserter from the Confederate Army at the close of the American Civil War who travels across the country to return home. Natalie Portman plays a young widow and mother who provides Inman with shelter and assists him in his quest. Cold Mountain was a major box office success in the United States, grossing $95 million of its total $173 million in North America. Portman does not have a significant amount of screen time in the picture, but she is a member of the cast that sold the film's attraction to the viewers that ultimately saw it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Mark Ruffalo Films, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=heat-1995---187-4-million>Heat (1995) - $187.4 Million</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to the presence of <a href=#>heavyweights such as Al Pacino</a> and Robert De Niro in leading parts, it is easy to overlook Natalie Portman's participation in Heat. However, she plays a significant role in Al Pacino's portrayal as his stepdaughter with whom he attempts to establish a relationship. Heat is regarded as one of the most significant crime dramas, achieving a financial triumph with a final gross of $187.4 million. As one of Portman's earliest appearances on the silver screen, she left her mark in a classic film that set her up for future success.</p><h2 id=black-swan-2010---329-4-million>Black Swan (2010) - $329.4 Million</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is typical to list Black Swan among the top films starring Natalie Portman, given that it is the picture for which she earned the <a href=#>Academy Award for Best Actress</a>. Her character descends into darkness as she gets preoccupied with becoming the lead ballerina in her production. Black Swan was a worldwide surprise hit, generating $329.4 million on a $13 million production. Portman's performance, which got fantastic reviews and thrilled both reviewers and audiences, was the film's selling point. Black Swan is the actress's most successful non-franchise picture.</p><h2 id=thor-2011---449-3-million>Thor (2011) - $449.3 Million</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jane Foster was mostly familiar to comic book enthusiasts at the time Thor was launched when the MCU was not at its peak popularity. However, the picture was a success, grossing $449.3 million and offering Portman another series in which to star. Thor introduces the protagonist when he meets Jane on Earth after being exiled there. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship between Portman and Hemsworth</a> was acclaimed, and Jane and Thor became an instant fan favorite. Thor's performance paved the way for subsequent films to achieve comparable box office returns.</p><h2 id=thor-the-dark-world-2013---644-8-million>Thor: The Dark World (2013) - $644.8 Million</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jane's prominent role in Thor: The Dark World established her as one of the most valiant MCU romantic characters. In the sequel, Portman played a larger role as Jane absorbed Reality Stone's powers and fought alongside Thor against the Dark Elves for its possession. Thor: The Dark World did not garner the best reviews, but its total of $644,8 million demonstrates that the picture did not rely on positive reviews. It was the highest-grossing non-Star Wars film for the actress, although fans did not see her reprise the character of Jane Foster for almost a decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Highest-Grossing Eddie Murphy Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones-2002---653-8-million>Star Wars: Episode II – Attack Of The Clones (2002) - $653.8 Million</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones</a> performed less well than its predecessor because of the law of diminishing returns, but still grossed $653.8 million. Natalie Portman resumed her role as Padmé Amidala, this time as a Naboo senator. The story of Padmé and Anakin Skywalker's relationship, which resulted in the births of Luke and Leia, is generally well-received by both critics and viewers. Attack of the Clones was nonetheless a box office success, despite the fact that some spectators were turned off by the film's extensive use of CGI. This was due to the strength of the Star Wars brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith-2005---868-4-million>Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge Of The Sith (2005) - $868.4 Million</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fans flock in droves to see Anakin Skywalker become Darth Vader in the last installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, which performed similarly to the first film. Padmé's story concluded with her death shortly after giving birth to Luke and Leia, prompting the departure of Natalie Portman. <a href=#>Star Wars</a>: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith successfully concluded the prequel trilogy with a final gross of $868.4 million. Many critics hailed the picture as the best of the three, indicating a considerable improvement in reception.</p><h2 id=star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace---1-027-billion>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace - $1.027 Billion</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a 16-year absence, there was little uncertainty that the first chronological entry in the Star Wars franchise would be a blockbuster. The initial run of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace grossed $924,3 million, while a later 3D re-release raised its ultimate gross to $1.027 million. While many reviews were harsh owing to the existence of characters like Jar Jar Binks, Portman's debut as Queen Padmé Amidala was considered one of the film's greatest elements. The Phantom Menace remains Portman's highest-grossing film more than two decades after its first release.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>This Is What Makes ‘The Rings of Power’ The Most Expensive TV Show Ever</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quirky Byte</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdmoJmctaa%2F02aeq6ejqLavs4ynmK2ZnJ6ybrzOq6ummZ5iurDCyJ6qZqqRo7imsI4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-natalie-portman-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-natalie-portman-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-natalie-portman-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-natalie-portman-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-natalie-portman-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-highest-grossing-natalie-portman-movies-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vince-shlomi-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vince-shlomi-net-worth-therichest.html>Vince Shlomi Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rhoc-s-kelly-dodd-rick-leventhal-wed-in-romantic-ceremony.html>RHOCs Kelly Dodd, Rick Leventhal Wed in Romantic Ceremony</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rhoc-s-kelly-dodd-rick-leventhal-wed-in-romantic-ceremony.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
