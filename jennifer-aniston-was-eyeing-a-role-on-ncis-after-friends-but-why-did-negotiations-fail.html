Believe it or not, Friends alum Jennifer Aniston was considered for a major role in this CBS police procedural television series.</p><p><a href=#>In the oral history of NCIS </a>from The Hollywood Reporter, the show’s creators, casting directors, and producer came together to share secrets about this hit series, including that Aniston showed interest in being a part of the show early on. The Friends star took a look at the script and wanted to play Special Agent Caitlin Todd. However, she was working on the last season of Friends at the time and she simply didn’t have time to be a regular on another series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What Is LL Cool J's Most Profitable Song?

However, NCIS casting director Susan Bluestein recalls something different. “I don’t remember ever offering it to Jennifer Aniston,” she explained, noting that the actress “could very well have been a name that we discussed.”</p><p>Aniston wasn’t the only A-lister considered for a key role on NCIS. As it turns out, producers also considered hiring a former Star Wars star to play the lead on the show. “I know Harrison Ford was a name that everybody thought about for [Leroy Jethro] Gibbs because he was so perfect,” Johnson revealed. “But I don’t think it ever got further than, it was a name thrown out.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-actress-beat-jennifer-aniston-to-the-role-of-caitlin-todd-in-ncis>This Actress Beat Jennifer Aniston To The Role Of Caitlin Todd In NCIS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar40632695.jpg><p>After Jennifer Aniston couldn’t take the role of Caitlin Todd in NCIS due to work commitments, Sasha Alexander was cast in this role instead. However, this actress wasn’t the first choice for the role.</p><p>Alexander didn’t appear in NCIS’ two-episode pilot. Instead, Robyn Lively, who is Blake Lively’s older half-sister, portrayed Agent Vivian Blackadder.</p><p>“They liked her, but they didn’t think she quite worked,” the series executive producer, Charles Floyd Johnson, admitted. “And so when the series got picked up, CBS said, ‘We’d rather move on.’ And then we went in search of a character, and Sasha came in at the last minute. I loved Robyn Lively, but those things do happen.” Ultimately, Lively’s character was replaced by Caitlin Todd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Renée Felice Smith Lives A Very Private Life But Her Instagram Reveals A Lot About The NCIS: Los Angeles Star</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, Sasha Alexander played Caitlin Todd in 50 episodes of NCIS. However, her character was killed at the end of season 2. The reason for this was that the actress decided to leave the show, due to its demanding work schedule.</p><p>"People don't realize that on a network show, you make 24 episodes a year — that's 10½ months a year, 17 hours a day. It's hardcore," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alexander revealed in an interview for TV Guide</a>, in which she also admitted she was not happy with the way producers handled her exit.</p><p>"Plus, people really loved the character, and the way they did it was really shocking...it was a bullet to the head, you know?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-sasha-alexander-after-leaving-ncis>What Happened To Sasha Alexander After Leaving NCIS?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar50734778.jpg><p>Sasha Alexander was the first actor to quit NCIS, although she came back on a couple of occasions to reprise the role of Caitlin Todd. While her net worth could have grown exponentially if she had decided to stay on NCIS for longer, it seems that Alexander made the right choice at the time. After departing from this popular procedural drama series, Alexander continued acting.</p><p>This actress has appeared in several popular shows and movies over the years. Some of her biggest projects include Lucky 13, Yes Man, a small role in Friends, The Ride, He’s Just Not That Into You, Mission: Impossible III, and a role in FBI, a series that is pretty similar to NCIS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, her two most noteworthy roles as her portrayal of Maura Isles in the series Rizzoli & Isles and her role as Helene Runyon in the SAG Award-winning series Shameless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn7KvusifnKtlkaO2tMDOp2SdoZSjwW6zxK1kmmWipLmmec6nZKebmah6orLTnqlmnqKesq%2Bw0mg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-eyeing-a-role-on-ncis-after-friends-but-why-did-negotiations-fail.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-eyeing-a-role-on-ncis-after-friends-but-why-did-negotiations-fail.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-eyeing-a-role-on-ncis-after-friends-but-why-did-negotiations-fail.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-eyeing-a-role-on-ncis-after-friends-but-why-did-negotiations-fail.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-eyeing-a-role-on-ncis-after-friends-but-why-did-negotiations-fail.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-aniston-was-eyeing-a-role-on-ncis-after-friends-but-why-did-negotiations-fail.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kentucky-hunting-forum-list-of-kentucky-hunting-discussions-and-forums.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kentucky-hunting-forum-list-of-kentucky-hunting-discussions-and-forums.html>Kentucky Hunting Forum List of Kentucky Hunting Discussions and Forums</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./drew-lachey-net-worth-therichest.html>Drew Lachey Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./drew-lachey-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
