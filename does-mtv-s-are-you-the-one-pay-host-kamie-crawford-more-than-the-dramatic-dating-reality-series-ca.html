With 8 seasons and more than 200 episodes, it's hard to believe that couples can really end up together after one person has been lying about who they are. <a href=#>Some Catfish couples keep talking</a> after their episodes. And others go their separate ways because the betrayal has been too much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People love watching Catfish for the drama, but they also have become big fans of hosts Nev Schulman and Kamie Crawford. After becoming the co-host in season 8 after Max Joseph's departure, Kamie stole the hearts of fans because of her compassionate personality and hilarious jokes. She also doesn't suffer fools, which is appreciated on a show like Catfish. Now that Kamie Crawford is also hosting Are You The One, which TV show pays her more money?</p><h2 id=how-much-was-kamie-crawford-paid-by-mtv>How Much Was Kamie Crawford Paid By MTV?</h2><p><a href=#>Manti Te'o's catfishing scandal</a> captivated people, and it makes sense that MTV's Catfish has been a hit since it first premiered in 2012. Every episode is full of mystery as Nev and Kamie try to get to the bottom of what's going on. Kamie and Nev are perfect co-hosts as their personalities are similar enough but contrast nicely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nev has been the host of Catfish since the very first episode and definitely has a lot of experience speaking to people who have been in dramatic and complicated online relationships. But Kamie adds some humor to the show and fans love her for it. Whether Kamie waves around a tiny red flag or says that she is skeptical about an episode, she has done a great job over the past few seasons.</p><p>At the beginning of part two of season 8, which premiered in early 2023, Nev shared that he would have a few guest co-hosts because Kamie was hosting Are You The One? Kamie has become a very successful TV host and it seems that she is making good money these days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kamie-crawford-catfish.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kamie Crawford made a deal</a> with MTV to host Catfish, Ex on the Beach, and Are You The One? according to Deadline. Her salary wasn't shared in the announcement. But, because she signed a new contract to host these three shows, it seems that Kamie must be getting paid more now than she has been for the past few seasons of Catfish. And it's definitely impressive.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Machine Gun Kelly Once Appeared On An Episode Of MTV's Catfish And Let His Anger Get The Best Of Him</a></span></p><p>According to Deadline, Kamie said of the news, “As a huge fan of reality TV centered around dating and working in the relationship advice space, it’s an absolute dream to now be hosting three shows based on finding love and making lifelong connections."</p><p>Kamie told Shadow And Act that it was thrilling to hear that she would be hosting these three shows. She said, “My first thought was, HOW? I thought there was no way that was even possible, but apparently, it is. I was so excited because I am such a huge fan of all three shows. So to be approached to host the shows is one thing, but for it to be [shows] that I am a fan of, that made it even better."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kamie-crawford-catfish-scene.jpg><p>Kamie also mentioned that she has been working hard for a long time. It seems like this deal felt especially great because she has been putting in the time for many years. She said, “I’ve been working as a host for 11 years, I’m 30 now, and I’ve been trying to break into the business since I was 19. So I think this is an accumulation of all my work over the years."</p><p>Variety reported in March 2023 that Kamie Crawford signed with CAA. While Kamie's net worth isn't known, several websites such as Nicki Swift suggest it is around $2 million. This would definitely be a result of years of hard work and of co-hosting Catfish for season 8's many episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kamie-crawford-2.jpg><p>It's exciting to watch Kamie host Are You The One? along with Ex on the Beach. She has a knack for telling it like it is and is incredibly smart. But Kamie is also super caring, and she's great at talking to people when they're feeling emotional or having a hard time. This makes her an empathetic Catfish co-host and also makes her a perfect addition to Are You The One? and Ex on the Beach.</p><h2 id=what-is-kamie-crawford-39-s-catfish-salary-and-is-it-true-that-she-quit>What Is Kamie Crawford's Catfish Salary And Is It True That She Quit?</h2><p>Although no one is certain of Kamie Crawford's Catfish salary, Distractify.com says that Nev Schulman's salary guesses have been all over the place. It has been said that Nev is paid $100,000 for every season of Catfish. And it has also been said that Nev is paid that amount for every episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is no way to know what Nev is getting paid unless he talks about it, and so far he hasn't mentioned his salary in interviews.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kamie-crawford-3.jpg><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Nev has a $2 million net worth, and that must be from his years of hosting Catfish. It's possible that both Nev and Kamie have been paid very well to host Catfish.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About 'Catfish' Host Nev Schulman's Life</a></span></p><p>When Nev Schulman announced that Kamie Crawford wouldn't be joining him for every season 8 episode of Catfish, people began wondering if Kamie had quit the reality show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kamie was away shooting Are You The One?</a> in Spain. She is definitely still a host on Catfish, which is good news since it would be a shame if the opposite were true. It's great that she has added two other reality dating shows to her schedule while still keeping her Catfish job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kamie-crawford-1.jpg><p>In an interview with TV Insider, Kamie shared that it was fun being in Spain and eating a lot of pasta. She said "it was a completely different experience" because she spent time in Europe instead of traveling across the United States to film Catfish. She said the cast members of Are You The One? have "fun dates" and the show leans into the location.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened To Lauren And Derek, The Real Couple On MTV’s ‘Catfish’?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kamie Crawford's success in the reality TV world is definitely a culmination of years of working. In 2010, Kamie won the title of Miss Teen USA. And since then, she has also worked as a model. According to her profile on All American Speakers, she has a lot of experience as a TV host as she worked for BET, NBC Universal and others in a freelance capacity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYrq1woyaqZ5lqaTCbsDHnmSoppVivaLFjKGmrKxdoK6utcRmmquZp5u8s7CMpqarnV2ptaK6jJyYrZ6ZqLVw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-mtv-s-are-you-the-one-pay-host-kamie-crawford-more-than-the-dramatic-dating-reality-series-ca.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoes-mtv-s-are-you-the-one-pay-host-kamie-crawford-more-than-the-dramatic-dating-reality-series-ca.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoes-mtv-s-are-you-the-one-pay-host-kamie-crawford-more-than-the-dramatic-dating-reality-series-ca.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoes-mtv-s-are-you-the-one-pay-host-kamie-crawford-more-than-the-dramatic-dating-reality-series-ca.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-mtv-s-are-you-the-one-pay-host-kamie-crawford-more-than-the-dramatic-dating-reality-series-ca.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-mtv-s-are-you-the-one-pay-host-kamie-crawford-more-than-the-dramatic-dating-reality-series-ca.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jay-inslee-net-worth-how-much-is-governor-inslee-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jay-inslee-net-worth-how-much-is-governor-inslee-worth.html>Jay Inslee Net Worth How Much is Governor Inslee Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./channel-addison-rae-s-rainy-day-style-with-these-tall-hunter-boots.html>Channel Addison Rae's Rainy Day Style With These Tall Hunter Boots</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./channel-addison-rae-s-rainy-day-style-with-these-tall-hunter-boots.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
