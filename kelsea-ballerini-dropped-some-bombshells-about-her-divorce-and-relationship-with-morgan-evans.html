The singers started dating in 2016 and tied the knot one year later in 2017, during a ceremony in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, in August 2022, the singers announced that they were divorcing after nearly five years of marriage. Ballerini first addressed the breakup over the summer. “I wanted you to hear from me directly that I am going through a divorce,” she began her statement at the time before calling the divorce a “deeply difficult decision” that was the “result of a journey of love, growth, and effort that ultimately has come to an end.”</p><p>The 29-year-old singer candidly revealed how her four-year marriage failed in a bombshell-filled interview on the Call Her Daddy podcast. It included huge revelations about her marriage, the split and her new relationship with Outer Banks actor Chase Stokes.</p><p>“I feel extremely grateful for the many years of marriage to Morgan and hopeful for the next seasons," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Morgan Evans added, “I am very sad to confirm that after almost 5 years of marriage, Kelsea and I are parting ways,” he wrote. “I wish it were otherwise, but sadly it is not.”</p><p>Here are some of the biggest revelations from Kelsea Ballerini's Call Her Daddy interview.</p><h2 id=kelsea-ballerini-never-wanted-to-get-married><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kelsea Ballerini Never Wanted To Get Married</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kelsea-and-morgan.jpg><p>Kelsea Ballerini grew up with divorced parents, which meant she once "swore" she would never get married.</p><p>“Being an only child, watching that, walking through that at 12, 13, those impressionable ages, I was just like, ‘I’m not doing it,'” she recalled.
