He works at a 9-5 job he doesn't really care about, he makes decent money, and he clearly has some pressing issues that he should be resolving.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="15 Times Monica And Chandler Were A Way Better Couple Than Ross And Rachel" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Times Monica And Chandler Were A Way Better Couple Than Ross And Rachel</a></span></p><p>While Rachel changed the most in terms of independence, Chandler grew the most emotionally. He always had his life under control, but the same couldn't be said about his self-esteem. Every friend group has a Chandler type and here are the telltale signs that give the Chandlers of the world away.</p><h2 id=you-re-the-smart-one><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>You're The Smart One</span></h2><p>Chandler went to Columbia University where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he met Ross</a>. He is the most adult of them all when we meet the group in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">season 1</a>. He has a job and it's clear that he is a professional in his field. Chandler is smart, witty, and he knows how to handle money.</p><p>Chandlers of the groups are the ones with reliable, well-paying jobs. They don't necessarily like what they do, but they're not the types that like risks. Chandler surprised us by the end of the series: he followed his heart and switched fields.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-re-desperate-for-love><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>You're Desperate For Love</span></h2><p>Chandler never ever shows his emotions, but he did make a point of admitting that he is desperate for love. He is very self-aware, but until he starts <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating Monica</a>, he doesn't really have much luck in love. He is so afraid of being abandoned that he pushes his romantic interests away before they get a chance.</p><p>Have you ever found yourself dating someone you don't even like all that much? Because that's exactly what happened to Chandler due to his hopeless desire to be loved. He dated Janice, even though he couldn't stand her. And he wasn't very successful with his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other love interests</a>, either.</p><h2 id=you-believe-in-your-friends><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>You Believe In Your Friends</span></h2><p>Chandler might come across as mean due to his sarcasm, but he actually really believes in his friends and supports them. Quite literary: he financially supported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joey</a> for ages. He wanted his friend to pursue his dream and it actually did come true!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Do you believe in your friends too? Do you think they're the greatest, even when they are struggling in life? You might not say I love you a lot, but you sure care about your friends from the bottom of your heart.</p><h2 id=you-hate-the-holidays><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>You Hate The Holidays</span></h2><p>Chandler is incredibly resistant to the idea that the group celebrates Thanksgiving together because he has such bad memories from childhood. In this regard, he is similar to Phoebe. But unlike her, he hasn't really processed his trauma and still experiences&nbsp; emotional flashbacks from time to time.</p><p>When Thanksgiving or Christmas roll around, do you wallow in sad memories or are you excited to make new ones with your awesome group of friends? We all know which one means that you're the Chandler.</p><h2 id=you-re-socially-awkward><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>You're Socially Awkward</span></h2><p>One of the most glaring issues is Chandler's use of humor. It's pretty clear that he uses it as a defense mechanism to prevent people getting too close to him, which was also pointed out by Phoebe's boyfriend the <span class=aCOpRe>psychiatrist.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chandler is very well aware of the situation. One time, he introduced himself by saying: "I'm Chandler, I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable". Do you excessively laugh or make jokes when you feel awkward? Do you flail with your arms and accidentally punch people? It's okay. Just try to relax, Chandler.</p><h2 id=your-friends-accept-you-the-way-you-are><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Your Friends Accept You The Way You Are</span></h2><p>If you're Chandler, you have a pretty amazing group of friends. They hold space for you, even though you clearly hate yourself and you feel uneasy around everybody, even your friends sometimes.</p><p>When people are too negative, cynical, and fearful, their friends tend to push them away. But not Chandler: Joey in particular always made a point to be there for him.</p><h2 id=no-one-knows-what-s-your-job><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>No One Knows What's Your Job</span></h2><p>Not knowing what Chandler does for a living is a running joke; it's even a part of one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the highest rated episodes of Friends</a> where Monica and Rachel lose their flat in a bet because they didn't know how to answer what Chandler's job is. All they knew is that he has a briefcase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chandler worked in a sector that was very new back then, so even his friends didn't understand what exactly it meant that he worked with data. Do your friends have any idea what your workday looks like? If not, you're Chandler.</p><h2 id=your-friends-like-to-make-fun-of-you><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Your Friends Like To Make Fun Of You</span></h2><p>Chandler is teased for the silliest little things, like his name and because he has a third nipple. Because he feels secure in his friendships, he doesn't let the joking get to him. They always know when to stop, so it never turns into bullying.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="15 Of The Most Hilarious Chandler Bing Quotes" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Of The Most Hilarious Chandler Bing Quotes</a></span></p><p>Are you teased for a certain personality trait or something you've done once? If you're the go-to person everybody likes to make fun of a bit, you're Chandler.</p><h2 id=you-can-t-stand-conflict><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>You Can't Stand Conflict</span></h2><p>If you think you're Chandler of the group, you probably can't stand conflict. And by conflict, we don't mean screaming matches; we mean communicating your wishes or desires to someone who can't read your mind. Chandler couldn't bring himself to tell his coworkers that his friend is not Toby and he resorted to lying instead of facing his problems head-on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Friends: 25 Things That Make No Sense About Chandler’s Relationships" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends: 25 Things That Make No Sense About Chandler’s Relationships</a></span></p><p>If you'd break up with your partner by telling them you're moving to Yemen rather than telling them the truth, you're Chandler.</p><h2 id=you-pretend-a-lot><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>You Pretend A Lot</span></h2><p>Similar to the point made above, Chandler often pretends to be interested in things he actually doesn't care about. He doesn't care about sports and would rather watch parades on TV, but he still watches sports with Joey and Ross to seem like one of the guys.</p><p>How well do your friends really know you? Do you just go along listening to their music and watching their kind of TV shows even though you couldn't care less about any of that stuff? Don't waste too much of your life doing things you don't actually want to do, since that breeds resentment.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a class=bc-title-link title="Friends: Rachel, Monica, And Phoebe’s Greatest Love Interests, Ranked" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends: Rachel, Monica, And Phoebe’s Greatest Love Interests, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0edKinqerXa68tr7EZquhnV2YtaK6w6Wcq2WSnruoec6fZLKnpad6p77InqWdZZenvLa8jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-signs-you-re-the-chandler-bing-of-your-friend-group.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-signs-you-re-the-chandler-bing-of-your-friend-group.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-signs-you-re-the-chandler-bing-of-your-friend-group.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-signs-you-re-the-chandler-bing-of-your-friend-group.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-signs-you-re-the-chandler-bing-of-your-friend-group.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-signs-you-re-the-chandler-bing-of-your-friend-group.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./6-of-the-world-s-most-invasive-plant-species.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./6-of-the-world-s-most-invasive-plant-species.html>6 Of The World's Most Invasive Plant Species</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-albin-jose-chellathurai-eighth-grade-teacher-arrested-by-savannah-police.html>Who Is Albin Jose Chellathurai?
