Fans were quick to accuse the English musician of being a "typical Disneyland dad."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One wrote: "It seems like Gwen has them 90% of the time based on what I've seen on social media. It's a lot easier to be the cool/relaxed parent when you only have them a few weeks a year lol."</p><p>Another commenter even brought up Rossdale's affair with their children's nanny. "He always acts so pissy and petty about Gwen — buddy, YOU'RE the one who cheated," said the fan. "Luckily, from everything the public can see, [<a href=#>Stefani's current husband Blake Shelton</a>] seems to really love and care for those boys."</p><p>Speaking of that, a source revealed that Rossdale has had <a href=#>a "challenging" relationship</a> with Shelton. Here's a closer look at the former couple's journey into "not co-parenting."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Shiloh Jolie-Pitt And Gavin Rossdale's Son Kingston?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-gwen-stefani-get-with-gavin-rossdale>When Did Gwen Stefani Get With Gavin Rossdale?</h2><p>Stefani and Rossdale first met in 1995 when the former's band No Doubt was on tour. They opened for the latter's band, Bush in London. The pair went on to date for six years before Rossdale proposed in January 2002. They got married nine months later. They also had two other ceremonies, one for Stefani's family in L.A. and another for friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar46703361.jpg><p>In 2004, the couple faced a shocking claim that Rossdale had fathered a child in 1989. After taking a paternity test, he was proven to be the dad of then-15-year-old model, Daisy Lowe. Two years later, he welcomed his first child with Gwen — Kingston James McGregor Rossdale. "Gwen’s doing great," Rossdale told People back then. "She looks amazing and she's doing real good."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They had Zuma Nesta Rock Rossdale in 2008 and Apollo Bowie Flynn Rossdale in 2014. In February 2015, the Hollaback Girl performer said that it was "good to have those days when we both do our own things," referring to Rossdale being on tour at that time.</p><p>"I think that's what keeps relationships going, when both people can be themselves and have their own individuality," she told Cosmopolitan. "That's especially important for women—it's hard to find time for yourself."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened To Gwen Stefani's Ex (And No Doubt Member) Tony Kanal?</a></span></p><h2 id=why-did-gavin-rossdale-and-gwen-stefani-get-divorced>Why Did Gavin Rossdale And Gwen Stefani Get Divorced?</h2><p>Just six months after her interview with Cosmopolitan, Stefani and Rossdale announced that they were getting divorced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"While the two of us have come to the mutual decision that we will no longer be partners in marriage, we remain partners in parenthood and are committed to jointly raising our three sons in a happy and healthy environment," they said in a joint statement for People. "To that end, we respectfully request privacy from the media during this time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gavin-Rossdale-and-Gwen-Stefani.jpg><p>A year after, the Luxurious hitmaker told Cosmopolitan that she "went through months and months of torture" during their split. When asked about the rumors about Rossdale's infidelity, she hinted: "All you have to do is listen to every single song I've ever written, and it's all there. It's an ongoing theme that I’ve had for a long time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She later told The Tommy Show that although she wished the divorce "didn't happen," she'd accepted that it was "part of my life journey." Talking about songwriting again, she said: "Because of my situation right now, which we all know what I'm talking about, I feel like I go back and listen to a lot of that stuff, and I'm, like, I get sick."</p><p>She continued: "You look at the songs and go, 'That was a red flag. That was a moment where I was feeling just as bad as I feel today, and why did I keep it up?'" In 2020, Rossdale told The Guardian that their divorce was the "most embarrassing moment" of his life."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Blake Shelton Really Feels About Gwen Stefani's Bare 'No Makeup' Look</a></span></p><h2 id=why-gwen-stefani-and-gavin-rossdale-39-don-39-t-co-parent-39>Why Gwen Stefani And Gavin Rossdale 'Don't Co-Parent'</h2><p>In an interview with the Not So Hollywood podcast in June 2023, Rossdale admitted that he and Stefani "don't co-parent" due to their opposing views, which he thinks offer their children an "incredible perspective." He then noted that they "just parent."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think you can go one of two ways – you can either do everything together and really co-parent, and see how that goes – or you can just parent.
