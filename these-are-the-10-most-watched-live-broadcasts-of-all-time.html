Once in a while, something tragic, exciting, or phenomenal happens that grabs the attention of the whole world. Soccer, for instance, has capitalized on live broadcasts. The Premier League has been entirely built on live-action that’s now an everyday affair. The World Cup finals between Croatia and France in 2018, alone, attracted a good 517 million viewers. Just like it, some events have occurred in the past that commanded numbers within that range, and even greater. Here they are:</p><h2 id=muhammad-ali-vs-george-foreman-1-billion-viewers><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Muhammad Ali vs. George Foreman (1 Billion Viewers)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fight between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali is regarded as one of the greatest sporting events of all time. The boxing match, dubbed ‘The Rumble in the Jungle,’ was one of a kind, as it was a representation of the battle between older and accomplished industry experts (Ali), and young, talented up-and-coming underdogs(Foreman). The fight, held in the Democratic Republic of Congo, attracted 60,000 attendees and generated over $100 million in revenue.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranking BTS's 10 Most Viewed Music Videos</a></span></p><h2 id=muhammad-ali-vs-antonio-inoki-1-4-billion-viewers><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki (1.4 Billion Viewers)</span></h2><p>On June 26, 1976, Muhammad Ali set yet another viewership record through his boxing match against Antonio Inoki. The match, dubbed ‘The War of the Worlds,’ took place in Tokyo, Japan. It was scheduled after Ali’s victory over Richard Dunn that saw him become the reigning WBC/WBA heavyweight boxing champion. The fight, refereed by Gene LeBell, resulted in a draw.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranking The 10 Most Viewed Carpool Karaoke Episodes</a></span></p><h2 id=aloha-from-hawaii-via-satellite-1-5-billion-viewers><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Aloha From Hawaii Via Satellite (1.5 Billion Viewers)</span></h2><p>The Aloha From Hawaii Via Satellite concert starred the legendary singer Elvis Presley and was broadcast from the Honolulu International Centre. Elvis had taken a seven-year break from performing to focus on his acting career. This major comeback was therefore much anticipated. The process commanded a $2.5 million budget that saw 36 countries tune in. Proceeds from the concert were directed towards the Kui Lee Cancer Fund.</p><h2 id=the-wedding-of-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-1-9-billion-viewers><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Wedding Of Prince Harry And Meghan Markle (1.9 Billion Viewers)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The recent months have seen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Harry</a> and Meghan Markle take a sabbatical from their royal duties. While this has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caused quite a bit of a stir</a>, the fact still remains that their wedding is one of the most viewed broadcasts of all time. Unlike other royal weddings that have often been held on weekdays, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding was an exception. Perhaps its weekend schedule highly contributed to the large viewership.</p><h2 id=live-aid-1-9-billion-viewers><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Live Aid (1.9 Billion Viewers)</span></h2><p>Arguably one of the biggest concerts ever broadcast, Live Aid was organized in July 1985 to raise funds for a famine-stricken Ethiopia. The event, dubbed the ‘global jukebox,’ was held simultaneously in London and the USA, and had a combined attendance of over 150,000 people. The concert eventually raised$127 million, more than what was needed to curb the hunger crisis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=live-8-2-billion-viewers><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Live 8 (2 Billion Viewers)</span></h2><p>The Live 8 was a chain of concerts that happened in the G8 states and South Africa. The charity-driven events took place in July 2005 and were scheduled to precede the G8 summit. To bring its point closer home, its model is what may have inspired the 'Global Citizen' movement. The number of concerts held on the day was ten, with a later concert being scheduled for the sixth of July. The entertainers that performed included key figures like Chris Martin, Madonna, Will Smith, and Paul McCartney.</p><h2 id=muhammad-ali-vs-larry-holmes-the-last-hurrah-2-billion-viewers><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Muhammad Ali vs. Larry Holmes: The Last Hurrah (2 Billion&nbsp;Viewers)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite announcing his retirement in June 1979, Muhammad Ali agreed to a fight with Larry Holmes. The boxing match, dubbed ‘The Last Hurrah’, was scheduled to take place in Rio De Janeiro, but that didn’t hold. Instead, the duo battled it out in Las Vegas. Muhammad Ali, who was on the verge of retirement, lost to Larry Holmes. The match, however, counts as one of the most viewed events in history.</p><h2 id=muhammad-ali-vs-leon-spinks-ii-2-billion-viewers><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Muhammad Ali vs. Leon Spinks II (2 Billion Viewers)</span></h2><p>The world of sports, without a shadow of a doubt, dominates live broadcasts. And Muhammad Ali, as it is, holds the record for the most viewed broadcasts based on an individual. The Muhammad Ali vs. Leon Spinks fight was broadcast on the 15th of September, 1978. The Louisiana Superdome rematch recorded an attendance of over 60,000 people, cost ABC a fortune to broadcast, and delivered the viewership it had promised.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-funeral-of-diana-princess-of-wales-2-5billion-viewers><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Funeral Of Diana, Princess Of Wales (2.5Billion Viewers)</span></h2><p>Princess Diana, often perceived as a royal misfit, was a darling to the public. Her sudden and untimely tragic death came as a shocker to the world. Her funeral attracted one of&nbsp; the largest viewerships ever recorded, a testament to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her legacy that continues to reveal itself through her youngest son, Prince Harry</a>. Britain alone, commanded 31 million viewers, while the rest of the world accounted for the high numbers witnessed.</p><h2 id=michael-jackson-s-memorial-service-2-5-billion-viewers><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Michael Jackson’s Memorial Service (2.5 Billion Viewers)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considered the King of Pop, Michael Jackson had a legendary career, possibly one of the best of its kind. He goes on record as the most awarded artist in history and broke numerous records while he was alive. Idolized by the best of the best, it goes without saying that his memorial service would top the list of the most-watched events of all time. Even on his last days, he took a bow like the king that he was.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ranking Miley Cyrus 10 Most Viewed Music Videos</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnqivsRmq6GdXaK8tMCMsJitm5iasW64yK%2BcZpqipK6lr8Csq6xln5t6orjLZquipZVk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthese-are-the-10-most-watched-live-broadcasts-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthese-are-the-10-most-watched-live-broadcasts-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthese-are-the-10-most-watched-live-broadcasts-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthese-are-the-10-most-watched-live-broadcasts-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthese-are-the-10-most-watched-live-broadcasts-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthese-are-the-10-most-watched-live-broadcasts-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jeff-hardy-net-worth-how-much-is-jeff-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jeff-hardy-net-worth-how-much-is-jeff-worth.html>Jeff Hardy Net Worth How Much is Jeff Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-most-expensive-horses-in-the-world.html>The Most Expensive Horses in the World</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-most-expensive-horses-in-the-world.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
