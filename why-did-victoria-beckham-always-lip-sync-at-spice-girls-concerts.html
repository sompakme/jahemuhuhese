Now a <a href=#>renowned designer and fashion icon</a>, Posh Spice has remained open about her experience in the girl group.</p><p><a href=#>Feuds with members</a> aside, Victoria has fond memories with the band, which she talked about in her husband, <strong><a href=#>David Beckham</a></strong>'s new Netflix documentary, Beckham. Still, she admitted to not being as outgoing as the rest of the girls.</p><p>In an interview in 2016, she also revealed that she lip-synced during their live performances. Those moments even became a meme on social media. Here's the story behind that.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/has-victoria-beckham-really-ate-the-same-foods-for-the-last-25-years_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Has Victoria Beckham Really Ate The Same Foods For The Last 25 Years?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Victoria Beckham's strict diet leaves some people wondering how she does it.</span><h2 id=why-was-victoria-beckham-nicknamed-posh-spice>Why Was Victoria Beckham Nicknamed Posh Spice?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-14.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a letter posted on the Instagram page of her luxury beauty brand, Victoria Beckham Beauty, Posh revealed that her nickname wasn't her first choice. "I was given the name Posh in 1996 over lunch with Peter Loraine of Top of The Pops Magazine and the rest of the Spice Girls," she recalled.</p><p>"I can't say it would've been my first choice, but I ultimately grew into it on my own term," she continued. "I was young and shy, and being Posh helped me find my style and confidence, and my voice." She went on to confess that the Posh brand posed some challenges in her personal and career life.</p><p>"After the Spice Girls, I distanced myself from the nickname because it had unwavering momentum of its own," she explained. "I wanted to find my own direction." Still, she's thankful for that time. "Now, years later, I look back at that formative time with appreciation," she added. "Posh forever changed the course of my life, opening the door for me to go after my dreams."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The open letter was a campaign for her Posh Lipstick at that time. "This week, I celebrate Posh with the launch of Posh Lipstick," Victoria said of her singing career's impact on her current venture. "It is deeply personal—lipstick has always given me confidence when I needed it and extra spice when I already had it."</p><p>She concluded the letter by saying: "Each shade is inspired by a specific memory, and whilst the moments may have been my own, the energy and emotion is shared by us all. This is an ode to our lifelong journeys of self discovery as women. Posh is back." It then sparked hope of Posh reuniting with the other Spices.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nicola-peltz-and-victoria-beckham-are-almost-identical-in-more-ways-than-one-here-s-the-erie-truth-about-brooklyn-beckham-s-wife-and-mother.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Nicola Peltz And Victoria Beckham Are Almost Identical In More Ways Than One: Here's The Erie Truth About Brooklyn Beckham's Wife And Mother</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite rumors of an alleged feud, Nicola Peltz and Victoria Beckham can't deny their strange similarities with each other.</span><h2 id=why-did-victoria-beckham-lip-sync-at-spice-girls-39-concerts>Why Did Victoria Beckham Lip Sync At Spice Girls' Concerts?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-spice-girls-at-virgin-records-headquarters.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a talk in London in 2016, Victoria admitted that she used to lip-sync during Spice Girls' concerts. "They used to turn [the mic] off and just let the others sing," she confessed at that time. "I got the last laugh — and now my mic is well and truly on, finally." That was in reference to her current platform that allows her to voice her opinions.</p><p>She also shared how she wasn't as much of a party girl back then. "When all the other girls were being fun and spontaneous and jumping on tables, I was always the one checking the table wasn't going to collapse. I was always the sensible one," she remembered. "Luckily because I used to wear heels, I just used to jig about a bit and I got away with it but it never came easily,"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was always much more reserved than the other girl," she continued. Luckily, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being in the band gave her access to all things high fashion</a>. "I was always the one that loved fashion — and it was quite a result for me because the girls always used to get their clothes for free because they were crap and so there was a lot of budget for me to have my little Gucci dress," she said, per Cosmopolitan.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/David-And-Victoria-Beckham-Fired-Their-Nanny-For-Leaking-Gossip-To-The-Press.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>David And Victoria Beckham Fired Their Nanny For Leaking Gossip To The Press</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>David and Victoria Beckham's former nanny hinted that there was trouble between the two behind closed doors.</span><h2 id=are-the-spice-girls-reuniting>Are The Spice Girls Reuniting?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-spice-girls-reunion-interview.jpg><p>In July 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told The Sun</a> that <a href=#>Victoria will be rejoining the Spice Girls</a> for their 30th anniversary. "For the past few years the Spice Girls have still been operating day-to-day as a four but, for the first time in a long time, Victoria is now chipping in and happy to celebrate a landmark 30 years of girl power," said the insider.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Their schedules are pretty manic so getting them all in one room at any one time is hard," they added. "But over the past six months there’s been more contact as a five than at any time since the 2012 Olympics. Victoria will be 50 next year, and the girls turning 30 seems like two ­anniversaries too good to miss."</p><p>Although they're not making new music, the source said that the group would like to headline the next Glastonbury Festival. "There will be no new music, and Victoria is adamant she doesn't want to perform live unless for an incredibly exciting one-off opportunity," they said.</p><p>There's also talks of an upcoming documentary, "which would show never-before-seen, behind-the-scenes footage plus present-day interviews." Early this October 2023, Posh and Scary Spice, Mel B were photographed together, finally putting their rift behind them. The Spice Girls themselves are said to be "on edge" over the reunion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbaledWimq2nop6ubq7EnKKhmZ1irq3DwLKqZqSZpXq0xc2cZJ2top67qHnSqaCcnV2ctrO40maaqKaTmr%2B1v44%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-victoria-beckham-always-lip-sync-at-spice-girls-concerts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-victoria-beckham-always-lip-sync-at-spice-girls-concerts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-victoria-beckham-always-lip-sync-at-spice-girls-concerts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-victoria-beckham-always-lip-sync-at-spice-girls-concerts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-victoria-beckham-always-lip-sync-at-spice-girls-concerts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-victoria-beckham-always-lip-sync-at-spice-girls-concerts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-pairs-of-tummy-control-leggings-to-add-to-your-wardrobe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-pairs-of-tummy-control-leggings-to-add-to-your-wardrobe.html>Best Pairs of Tummy-Control Leggings to Add to Your Wardrobe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-king-abdullah-of-jordan-s-mother.html>Who is King Abdullah of Jordans mother?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-king-abdullah-of-jordan-s-mother.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
