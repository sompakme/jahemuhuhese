<time>24 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>When I first started creating <a href=#>websites back in the mid-90s</a>, it was quite a task! Not only was everything in HTML, it was also a process of individually uploading images, pages, making sure they were all connected together, using FTP software and everything in between. I actually used this same process to create all of my sites up until 2007, then I started using WordPress — which also lead to a massive uprising of drag-and-drop site builders that quickly eliminated the need to ever touch a line of code or have any required design or site skills.</p><p>This is exactly what you will find at&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>SITE123</a>, one of the top sites on the internet for creating a website within minutes, and also never needing to worry about technical design skills or hiring a designer to work on site. SITE123 has made this process extremely easy and straightforward by allowing users to sign up, select a ready-made style or layout from their directory, then add content and go live with their site.</p><p>It’s really that simple, and today we are going to look at why and how SITE123 became one of the top go-to sources for creating a site online.</p><h2>SITE123 Makes Website Building Easy</h2><p>As you can imagine, the website hosting and creation space are extremely competitive. However, SITE123 has established themselves as one of the key players in this space, while also providing their users with everything they need to get started with a personal or professional website of their own. In fact, there are now more than 1.25 million websites running on their site builder platform right now.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-06-18_17-36-39-1024x521.png alt width=740 height=377 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>If you’ve ever wanted to start a website of your own, but haven’t made the leap yet, there were probably a few common reasons why. More often than anything else, people are scared of the idea of going live with a site and needing to learn something new. Another common reason is the associated costs of having a website. The last reason might have been that you just didn’t know what you would do with a website in the first place.</p><p>SITE123 makes this decision process quite simple, while also giving you solutions to these many questions in the process. As mentioned, SITE123 makes the process of creating a website dead-simple, and there are no design skills required.&nbsp;The platform also allows users to get started with a website of their own for free, which provides 500MB of storage, 1GB of bandwidth and also a subdomain. As for the reasoning of why you might want to start a website… I could give you a million! However, consider your options with starting an online diary, a blog, a new business, something you are interested in, or maybe just throwing together a few ideas and going live with a site, then seeing where it goes.</p><p>No matter why you create a website, SITE123 makes the process easy.</p><h2>The Most Simple Site Builder Ever?</h2><p>Over the years, I’ve tried a lot of different platforms and built many websites using drag-and-drop platforms or even complete CMSs like WordPress. If you are completely new to site building and don’t want to mess around with any of these advanced CMS platforms of designers, you will love how simple SITE123 is.</p><p>After creating a free account on their site, I was able to create the start of my new site (below) in less than two minutes. Simple click on any area of the site design on the right side of the page, then you can fill in the details and customize it through the options on the left side menu.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-06-18_17-40-21-1024x537.png alt width=740 height=388 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the screen above you can see the “Homepage” customization options, but also take notice of the many other sections as well — such as the inner pages, design, settings, domain, and more. Click on any of these areas, and a whole new tab section will appear for you to make all of the customizations and changes to your site.</p><p>You can actually watch the short 2-minute video below to see how quick and easy it is to run through the site design wizard and completely customize the look and feel of your site in just minutes.</p><p>Of the many features built into SITE123, I love how the site is instantly being made and updated as you created it. This will make the content creation and design process so much easier for anyone who is completely new to the concept of site ownership.</p><h2>SITE123 Offers a Wide Range of Site Templates</h2><p>Earlier I touched upon some of the most common reasons why someone might not have a website of their own yet. We also covered how easy it is, but we can also see the many different ideas, focuses, and markets you could create a site for as well.</p><p>When you first sign up for a SITE123 account, one of the first questions is what type of website are you interested in building? Based on your selection, the site builder will then select a theme that you can start working off of.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/site123-4-1024x590.png alt width=740 height=426 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>No matter which of the categories or templates you choose, each user is given access to a wide range of features that are built right into the platform. These features include, but aren’t limited to:</p><ul><li>free hosting</li><li>free SSL/HTTPS encryption</li><li>unlimited web pages</li><li>email accounts</li><li>24/7 website support</li><li>access to their large image, icon and video library</li></ul><p>Depending on the focus of your site and the style you go for, users will also find different features and design structures within each theme. A perfect example of this would be if you selected “photography”, you would then find the theme is more visual focused and allows for the uploading and displaying of images and photos throughout the site.</p><p>To truly understand and experience the many features and site designs on the platform, it’s best to sign up for a free account and start playing around with the <a href=# rel=noopener>site builder tool</a>.</p><h2>How to Start a Blog with SITE123</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, there are many drag-and-drop site designers on the marketplace today, but many of them are just for building static sites. What makes SITE123 stand out from the crowd is that <a href=# rel=noopener>they have blogging capabilities</a> built right into their platform. This makes the concept of blogging even easier, and especially for anyone who might want to avoid learning how to use WordPress altogether.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SITE123-Blogging-1024x585.png alt width=740 height=423 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Keeping with the simplistic navigation and setup as most of the features on SITE123, setting up your own blog through their platform is quite simple as well. All you need to do is select the “Add New Post” button, and start adding your content. The option is also there to edit/delete content as needed.</p><p>Just like all website and design templates on SITE123, blogs are fully responsive and viewable on all devices as well.</p><p>When working on an individual post (shown below), the option is also there to schedule for your content to go live at any given time. You can also see the text/formatting options on the right side of the page as well. All extremely simple to use, and pretty much no technical learning or design skills required.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SITE123-Blogging-Post-1024x576.png alt width=740 height=416 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>If you are familiar at all with the concept of blogging, this will all seem quite simple. If not, SITE123 makes the process easy enough. All it takes is a click of a button to insert images and videos, add links to your text, adding tags, titles and descriptions are also a breeze as well.</p><p>Again, the best way to learn and experience this firsthand is to simply create an account and see what you can start making on your own.</p><h2>What is the real cost of SITE123?</h2><p>SITE123 is a business — which means they need to make money. However, they’ve done an extremely good job at catering to all markets with this, while also making their technology and site builder free for anyone who wants to go live with a site of their own.</p><p>If you would like to go live with a free site, all you need to do is sign up and that’s what you will get. This includes a subdomain, and limitations of&nbsp;500 MB of storage and 1 GB of monthly bandwidth. For anyone just wanted to get started with a personal site of their own and wanting to learn the process, this is more than perfect.</p><p>However, if you want to go more professional and start a business or branded website, it’s definitely recommended to go with one of their premium plans — which start out at just $9.80 per month. You can see a break down of each payment and membership plans below.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SITE123-Payment-Plans-1024x554.png alt width=740 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Some of the most immediate benefits of going with an upgraded plan on SITE123 is getting a free domain name, having the branded floating tag removed, and also the ability to set up e-commerce features on your site and getting much higher levels of storage and bandwidth.</p><p>Now that you’ve seen how easy it is to <a href=# rel=noopener>create a site with SITE123</a>, why not create an account and get started with one of your own?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunC%2FyK2campjYsCqwMRmma6hnJmys3s%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-to-build-a-website-in-three-simple-steps-with-site123-site-builder.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-to-build-a-website-in-three-simple-steps-with-site123-site-builder.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-to-build-a-website-in-three-simple-steps-with-site123-site-builder.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-to-build-a-website-in-three-simple-steps-with-site123-site-builder.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-to-build-a-website-in-three-simple-steps-with-site123-site-builder.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-build-a-website-in-three-simple-steps-with-site123-site-builder.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./katharine-mcphee-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./katharine-mcphee-net-worth-therichest.html>Katharine McPhee Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./giada-de-laurentiis-husband-embarrassed-by-john-mayer-rumor.html>Giada De Laurentiis' Husband &amp;quot;Embarrassed&amp;quot; by John Mayer Rumor</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./giada-de-laurentiis-husband-embarrassed-by-john-mayer-rumor.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
