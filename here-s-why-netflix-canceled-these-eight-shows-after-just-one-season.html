The main reasons for the show's cancellation were low ratings, messy storylines, and an unrelatable lead character. Amoruso posted on Instagram, “I was privileged to work with incredible talent, but living my life as a caricature was hard, even if only for two months. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes, I can be difficult.

An online review from Decider said, “Cursed works when it sticks to Nimue and Arthur and doesn’t when it comes to just about anything else.” Other reasons include production costs and the Coronavirus pandemic. With the production coming to a halt in 2020, the series' cancellacation seems to have been a case of bad timing.</p><h2 id=sherlock-holmes-in-39-the-irregulars-39><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sherlock Holmes In 'The Irregulars'</span></h2><p>The Irregulars is a supernatural series following a group of teenage criminals in late 1800s London with magical powers.
