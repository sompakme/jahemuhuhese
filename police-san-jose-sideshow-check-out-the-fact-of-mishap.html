The neighborhood had been plagued by the nightly cacophony of squealing tyres, exploding fireworks, and crowded streets.</p><p>Officers were busy on Sunday morning removing vehicles and writing tickets to 720 persons who took part in or watched the spectacle at Branham Lane and Monterey Highway intersection.</p><p>After receiving reports of freak shows happening all around town, your patrol officers were called out last night to investigate.</p><p>We could stop around 500 automobiles and people at Monterey/Branham by responding in a huge, coordinated manner.</p><p>&nbsp;Moreover, it contacted 82 minors at the carnival, and their parents were notified.</p><p>The police department’s stance has changed, and the citations handed out to spectators during Saturday’s event reflect that.</p><p>According to the authorities, there were many abandoned vehicles after the circus act, including two stolen vehicles.</p><p>Police in San Jose, California, wrote on social media that “a ghost gun was discarded as well, hazardous and reckless that someone would just chuck a gun like it was rubbish.”</p><p>One person also reported being carjacked at the location, according to police.</p><p>The new sideshow law in San Jose is another factor; it makes it a misdemeanor with a $1,000 fine to perform in or attend a sideshow. Promoting a sideshow in any way, online or off, is against the law as of June.</p><p>For former San Jose City Council member Johnny Khamis, who played a key role in the creation of the ordinance, this is what they hoped would happen: that the police would have enough teeth to start enforcing laws and making it worthwhile and painful for those people who are abusing the system.</p><p>This circus act began in South San Jose on November 12 near the corner of Monterey Highway and Branham Lane.&nbsp;</p><p>They Told police vehicles on the ground to park by a police helicopter, blocking the intersection and trapping the sideshow drivers and spectators within.</p><p>The new procedure has been in the works for a few months by the SJPD’s air support unit. The Team of Police personnel is required to contain criminal activity effectively.</p><p>The operation took over eight hours of police time. It mostly spent time issuing citations (720 in total) and holding around 500 vehicles (of which 17 were seized).&nbsp;</p><p>The police department says it was lucky to have enough policemen available to pull it off that night but may need to be luckier with future sideshows.</p><p>Only sometimes, but we will use that strategy whenever possible, Shab told NBC Bay Area.NBC Bay Area.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC8zqWgnJ1dqK6vecmoqp5lo56xpr%2FHqK5o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpolice-san-jose-sideshow-check-out-the-fact-of-mishap.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpolice-san-jose-sideshow-check-out-the-fact-of-mishap.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpolice-san-jose-sideshow-check-out-the-fact-of-mishap.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpolice-san-jose-sideshow-check-out-the-fact-of-mishap.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpolice-san-jose-sideshow-check-out-the-fact-of-mishap.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpolice-san-jose-sideshow-check-out-the-fact-of-mishap.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pretty-mike-of-lagos-biography-controversies-age-business-net-worth-girlfriend-wikipedia-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pretty-mike-of-lagos-biography-controversies-age-business-net-worth-girlfriend-wikipedia-wife.html>Pretty Mike Of Lagos Biography: Controversies, Age, Business, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Wikipedia, Wife</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./paul-rudd-through-the-years-photos.html>Paul Rudd Through the Years: Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./paul-rudd-through-the-years-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
