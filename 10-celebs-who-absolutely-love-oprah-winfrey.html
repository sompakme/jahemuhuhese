Oprah Winfrey is known for being a talk show host, a philanthropist, an actress, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Truth About Howard Stern's Relationship With Oprah Winfrey</a></span></p><p>Her friends often fit into those categories too. Oprah Winfrey has been around making waves since the late '80s. When she was 32 years old, she ended up becoming the first African American person (male or female) to nationally host a television show. Her success has continued to build and grow since then, and so have her friendships.</p><h2 id=tom-hanks><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Tom Hanks</span></h2><p>One of Oprah Winfrey's good friends in the Hollywood industry is Tom Hanks. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">During an interview</a>, he spoke highly of Oprah saying that she was a "one of a kind" woman and she makes the world a better place. He even added that she could potentially become the president of the United States. His opinion of her is filled with so much respect and admiration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meryl-streep><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Meryl Streep</span></h2><p>Oprah Winfrey has never run for president but back in 2018, <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a> endorsed her anyway. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She said</a>, "[Oprah] launched a rocket tonight. I want her to run for president. I don’t think she had any intention [of declaring]. But now she doesn’t have a choice.” Meryl made this statement after Oprah's&nbsp;lifetime achievement speech. Meryl and Oprah are still good friends today.</p><h2 id=reese-witherspoon><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Reese Witherspoon</span></h2><p><a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> and Oprah Winfrey have always been good friends but they got even closer after they starred in A Wrinkle in Time together in 2018. For Oprah's 66th birthday in 2020, Reese posted a very sweet tribute! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She wrote</a>, "Happy birthday @Oprah!! It is an honor to know and walk through this world with you. Thank you for sharing your wisdom and advice… it is truly invaluable!" The love is mutual.</p><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jimmy Kimmel</span></h2><p>Back in the day, <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel</a> made the mistake of doing blackface while trying to do an impersonation of Oprah Winfrey. Fast forward to today and things are a lot different. He has apologized for doing such inappropriate non-comedy and he has been interviewed by Oprah a handful of times. They both know the importance of creating successful talk show entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gayle-king><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Gayle King</span></h2><p>The friendship between <a href=#>Gayle King</a> and Oprah Winfrey has been going on for years. They have an extremely strong bond that is pretty much unbreakable. They met for the first time in 1976 when they were both up and coming journalists.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Did Oprah Winfrey And Gayle King Become Friends?</a></span></p><p>They were interested in a lot of the same things so a friendship between the two was inevitable. As of now, Gayle is the&nbsp;editor-at-large for O, The Oprah Magazine. They have openly supported each other this whole time.</p><h2 id=john-travolta><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>John Travolta</span></h2><p>In 2010, a list of Oprah's favorite moments with <a href=#>John Travolta</a> were posted to her official website which can only mean one thing-- she really enjoys his company! She mentioned his&nbsp;November 26, 1996, appearances on her show when he danced his way across the stage. She also mentioned his&nbsp;June 11, 1999, appearance where he discussed what brings him joy in life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maria-shriver><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Maria Shriver</span></h2><p>Maria Shriver and Oprah Winfrey have been friends for decades!

You were the first friend I made outside of my family. I was raised in this clan mentality; the only people who could understand what I was experiencing were my siblings and cousins." They are like sisters to each other.</p><h2 id=ellen-degeneres><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ellen DeGeneres</span></h2><p>Successful talk show hosts have to stick together it seems!&nbsp;<a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey</a> have both hosted really incredible and popular talk shows so they have that major thing in common. They are so different in so many ways but they know how to be inquisitive of guests, they know how to inspire, and they know how to change the lives of average individuals through generosity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=busy-philipps><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Busy Philipps</span></h2><p>When <a href=#>Busy Philipps</a> got a phone call from Oprah Winfrey on her own talk show, she was so moved that she was brought to tears. She had always been such a fan of Oprah so when Oprah actually reached out to her, she was so excited and could not even maintain her composure. The respect and admiration that Busy has for Oprah is so apparent! Oprah returns those sentiments.</p><h2 id=mindy-kaling><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mindy Kaling</span></h2><p>Just like Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling also starred in A Wrinkle in Time with Oprah Winfrey. The adventure fantasy film focuses on a little girl going on a mission to try to find her father who has gone missing into space. The family-friendly movie is worth the watch!
