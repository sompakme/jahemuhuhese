The episode showcased the potential of CoinOut and garnered significant attention from both the sharks and the audience.</p><p>During his <b>pitch</b>, Witten sought a $250,000 investment in exchange for a 7.5% equity stake in the company. The sharks had mixed reactions, with Kevin O’Leary expressing concerns about competition in the cashback app industry. However, Barbara Corcoran and Kevin O’Leary both made competitive offers that caught Witten’s attention.</p><p>Barbara Corcoran proposed a $250,000 investment for a 15% equity stake, but with a condition. Corcoran insisted that CoinOut must partner with 700 new retail locations within the next six months to secure the deal.
