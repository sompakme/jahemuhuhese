They are still close with each other but as far as the rest of the world? They like having their personal lives kept personal. Here's what we know about them in 2020.</p><h2 id=mary-kate-has-been-horseback-riding><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mary-Kate Has Been Horseback Riding</span></h2><p>Mary-Kate Olsen totally loves horses. And more than that? She loves to partake in horseback riding! Horseback riding is not some easy feat for people to do whenever they feel like it. It required diligent training and focus. It requires a lot of balance because if you are not balanced on top of that horse, you will be very likely to fall off. Mary-Kate has been riding horses for years and she still does in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-is-dating-an-artist-named-louis-eisner><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ashley Is Dating An Artist Named&nbsp;Louis Eisner</span></h2><p>Ashley Olsen is currently in a relationship with Louis Eisner. He is an artist and the two have been dating for a couple of years now. They seem to be very happy together despite the fact that she hasn't really discussed him or the relationship to any public news outlets since the relationship began. Her fans have to do a lot of guessing and speculating when it comes to her romance.</p><h2 id=mary-kate-filed-for-divorce-from-french-banker-olivier-sarkozy><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mary-Kate Filed For Divorce From French Banker Olivier Sarkozy</span></h2><p>At the start of the pandemic, Mary-Kate Olsen had to file for an emergency <a href=#>divorce order from Olivier Sarkozy</a>, the French banker she was married to for the last five years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Real Reason Behind The Mary-Kate Olsen- Olivier Sarkozy Divorce</a></span></p><p>She cited in her letter that she feared losing her home and belongings to him as he was trying to give her the boot in the middle of the pandemic.

They both live on the Upper East Side in a place that reminds just about every person of <a href=#>Gossip Girl</a> starring Blake Lively and Leighton Meester as <a href=#>Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf</a>. The Olsen twins are so financially successful and wealthy that they can choose to live wherever in the world they want.</p><h2 id=both-sisters-are-cautiously-wearing-masks-during-the-pandemic><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Both Sisters Are Cautiously Wearing Masks During The Pandemic</span></h2><p>Both Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are&nbsp;making sure to wear masks on their faces every time they leave the house.

They are not new to walking Met Gala red carpets... this is something they have done for several years. Before the pandemic fully took over and caused everything to close down or get canceled, the sisters had the opportunity to show off another fashionable look for the cameras on the red carpet. The Met Gala is known for being the most high-end fashion event of the year.</p><h2 id=both-sisters-turned-34-years-old-in-2020><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Both Sisters Turned 34 Years Old In 2020</span></h2><p>In 2020, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen celebrated their 34th birthdays. They were both born on&nbsp;June 13, 1986! According to astrological charts, that means the two sisters are Geminis. It is very cool that they are Geminis because that particular zodiac sign represents the twins... and they are twins!</p><h2 id=both-sisters-are-still-in-charge-of-fashion-lable-the-row><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Both Sisters Are Still In Charge Of Fashion Lable 'The Row'</span></h2><p>Both Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are in charge of a high-end fashion label called The Row. In 2020, their label was nominated for a few awards! They care about style, trends, and keeping up with the latest fashion looks which is why it makes sense for the two sisters to be in charge of a fashion label.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=both-sisters-are-still-avoiding-acting-roles><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Both Sisters Are Still Avoiding Acting Roles</span></h2><p>When asked about taking up acting again at some point, Mary-Kate Olsen told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle Magazine</a>, “We’ve been there, we’ve done that, we started out that way. But this is the way we chose to move forward in our lives: to not be in the spotlight, to really have something that speaks for itself.” If they did ever choose to return to acting, it would be so much fun to see them in a new movie or TV show.</p><h2 id=both-sisters-are-still-avoiding-social-media><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Both Sisters Are Still Avoiding Social Media</span></h2><p>Both Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are still completely off of all social media platforms. That is right... they are not on Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, or any social media platform. It is a bummer that Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen prefer not to use social media because keeping up with them in that manner would be awesome for their fans. They choose to keep things very private in their lives.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's What It's Like To Work For Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZK2glWK8rb%2FEp2Str5mjwG6t0Z5krqhdqbxutc1maWlqYGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-what-the-olsen-twins-are-up-to-in-2020.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhere-s-what-the-olsen-twins-are-up-to-in-2020.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-what-the-olsen-twins-are-up-to-in-2020.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhere-s-what-the-olsen-twins-are-up-to-in-2020.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-what-the-olsen-twins-are-up-to-in-2020.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-what-the-olsen-twins-are-up-to-in-2020.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jim-carrey-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jim-carrey-net-worth-therichest.html>Jim Carrey Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./exclusive-photo-of-cm-punk-at-chicago-cubs-mlb-game.html>Exclusive: Photo of CM Punk at Chicago Cubs MLB Game</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./exclusive-photo-of-cm-punk-at-chicago-cubs-mlb-game.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
