After he moved to the United States with his parents and four siblings as a child, he started showcasing his skills at talent shows. With his older brother River, the actor worked in commercials and made his acting debut in television shows. His career took off during the mid-90s when he starred as the lead and supporting actor in a string of commercially and <a href=#>critically successful movies</a>. After taking a short hiatus after 2010 and returning to the big screen, he received his much-awaited Oscar in 2019 for playing the comic-book villain in the 2019 thriller Joker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Phoenix has worked in 55 films to date and has amassed a $55 million fortune as an actor, producer, and musician. As the actor actively pursues his cinema roles, his net worth expands.</p><h2 id=developing-as-a-young-actor>Developing As A Young Actor</h2><p>During the early 1980s, Joaquin Phoenix made cameos and guest appearances in shows and movies while his brother had begun his successful career. The actor was only 19 when his 23-year old brother River Phoenix died from a drug overdose in Hollywood in 1993, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>. Affected by his death, the actor didn’t work for two years until his comeback in the movie 'To Die For' that <a href=#>starred Nicole Kidman</a>. In 2000, he starred in Ridley Scott’s blockbuster hit Gladiator which genuinely established him as an up-and-coming actor and earned him an Academy Award in the Supporting Actor category.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Julianne Moore's Journey To Stardom And How She Earns Her Millions</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same year, he also starred in the critically acclaimed movie Quills, where he beat actors like Guy Pearce and Jude Law to grab the role of Abbé du Coulmier.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>, he produced music and directed videos for various artists during his time off acting. Phoenix made a comeback in 2012 with the movie The Master, which Paul Thomas Anderson directed. His performance as a tormented alcoholic earned him a lot of praises and the award for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival.</p><p>He starred as Theodore in the science fiction romance movie Her, directed by Spike Jonze. While the movie was indie, the director raised a $23 million budget and paid Phoenix a little over $2 million to play the introvert. Jonze decided to cast him in the movie after watching his late-night show appearance on The Late Show With <a href=#>David Letterman</a>, where his style assured him that he was perfect for the role, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>. He went on to work with Woody Allen in the 2015 movie Irrational Man where he was paid roughly $6,030 and $20,928. Allen is famously known to pay actors minimum wage salaries every week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-role-he-was-meant-to-play>A Role He Was Meant To Play</h2><p>After earning the award for Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival for the 2017 mystery/drama You Were Never Really Here, Todd Phillips offered him the role that soon became synonymous with his name, Joker. With engaging trailers and the mystery behind the plot, Joker was destined to be a box-office hit.</p><p>When the movie hit the theatres, it shattered records to become the <a href=#>highest-grossing film</a> at the box office in 2019, earning over $1 billion. Phoenix’s portrayal of the complex character that he portrayed with utmost dedication earned him an Academy Award in the Best Actor Category. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, the actor was paid $4.5 million for the titular role that made a clean sweep at the awards season. As Joker made a significant impact on the box office and fans are waiting for its sequel, Warner Studios is offering Phoenix his biggest payday to date, $50 million to star in two sequels for the movie. While there are no dates announced yet, people are eagerly waiting to see him reprise the role of Arthur Fleck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joaquin Phoenix has had a remarkable career that has spanned over three decades.
