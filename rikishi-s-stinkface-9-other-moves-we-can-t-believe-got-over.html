Whether it be making a small tweak to an existing move that has taken place before or something completely new, there have been plenty of amazing things shown over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>9 Best Versions Of The Piledriver, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Some of those moves have been amazing, yet that's not always the case. Others have been quite poor or very comical, yet with the right build-up and selling, anything can get over. Throughout wrestling some truly insane moves have ended up getting over with the crowd, showing that anything can end up being popular.</p><h2 id=the-stinkface-rikishi><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Stinkface (Rikishi)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Paul-Heyman-takes-the-Stinkface-Cropped.jpg><p>One of the wildest moves to have ever gotten over with the fans was The Stinkface. <a href=#>Rikishi made the most of his asset</a> when it came to creating this move, launching himself ass-first into his opponent who would be propped on the bottom turnbuckle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The move got over simply because fans found it so disgusting, with this being something that they wouldn't want to happen to them. In that aspect, it worked really well for him and it did end up being an iconic part of the Attitude Era.</p><h2 id=rear-view-naomi><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Rear View (Naomi)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rear-View-Cropped-(1).jpg><p>Sticking to the same theme, <a href=#>Rikishi's daughter-in-law</a>, Naomi also has a very strange finisher that has managed to get over with fans. Rear View is not one of the best finishers in wrestling, and considering how athletic she is, there's no doubt that Naomi could do something very different.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ranking The Members Of The Anoa'i Family</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, she doesn't need to, because the Rear View has been a major hit from day one. Whenever she performs the move it gets a big reaction, and while it doesn't look as impactful as other moves, it's something that works for her.</p><h2 id=double-foot-stomp-alberto-del-rio><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Double Foot Stomp (Alberto Del Rio)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Alberto-Del-Rio-Double-Foot-Stomp-Cropped.jpg><p>Sometimes a move is ridiculous because it is funny or doesn't look painful, and other times it is because of the actual setup. That was the case with Alberto Del Rio's Double Foot Stomp finisher, which is one of the worst moves in recent history.</p><p>While it obviously looks painful, hence why it would get a reaction, the way this was setup was terrible. Seeing the wrestler literally hold themselves up with the ropes so they could be hit with a move just never made sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rebound-clothesline-dean-ambrose><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Rebound Clothesline (Dean Ambrose)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dean-Ambrose-Clothesline-Cropped.jpg><p>Dean Ambrose has a lot of amazing moves, but the rebound clothesline isn't one of them. This move got crazier as time progressed and there was no point when it looked good or believable, as Ambrose would bounce off the ropes to then nail a clothesline.</p><p>However, this wouldn't just be a small bounce from the ropes. It would see him almost fall out of the ring and then somehow bounce back to nail the move, but despite how insane it was, the WWE Universe always loved seeing it.</p><h2 id=licking-faces-the-bushwhackers><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Licking Faces (The Bushwhackers)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Buschwhackers-at-the-Hall-Of-Fame-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Bushwhackers were very much a comedic tag team, and they were one that managed to get over with the WWE Universe. Whether it was the silly way they marched around the ring or the insane face-licking they did, it seemed like they could do no wrong.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 WWE Tag Teams & Their Hall Of Fame Counterparts</a></span></p><p>The face-licking move wasn't something that was supposed to hurt people, but it was more to creep them out and make them feel uncomfortable. But the WWE Universe would go crazy for it every single time, despite how insanely silly it was.</p><h2 id=chokeslam-the-hurricane><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chokeslam (The Hurricane)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hurricane-Chokeslam-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The Chokeslam is obviously a brilliant move</a> that fans are well aware of and really enjoy. However, this is typically done by big powerhouses such as Kane or Big Show, that is why it was always ridiculous when The Hurricane used it.</p><p>Of course, that was the point, it was supposed to be silly and suit the superhero character, but there was certainly a risk of things going too far with this one. But, because Hurricane fully committed, this move became very popular with the audience.</p><h2 id=atomic-leg-drop-hulk-hogan><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Atomic Leg Drop (Hulk Hogan)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Hulk-Hogan-Leg-Dropping-The-Undertaker.jpg><p>A move as simple as <a href=#>the Leg Drop</a> had no right getting over in the way that it did. It's one of the most basic finishers in wrestling history, and still, it's one of the most iconic. Every time Hulk Hogan would hit this move, fans would go crazy for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's something that fans have loved from the start, despite the fact there is such little movement involved in it. Things like this get done on a regular basis, but Hogan's version was always extra special, which is why it somehow became so popular.</p><h2 id=people-39-s-elbow-the-rock><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>People's Elbow (The Rock)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Rock-giving-the-Peoples-Elbow-to-Bray-Wyatt-1.jpg><p>Much like Hulk Hogan, it was more The Rock's star power and charisma that got this move over than the actual action itself. The People's Elbow was another move that was basic and <a href=#>didn't actually look like it hurt at all</a>.</p><p>The setup was long and over the top, which made it hard to believe that the wrestler underneath wouldn't just move out of the way. However, the drama and sass that The Rock brought whenever he delivered this would lead to fans going wild.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-cobra-santino-marella><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Cobra (Santino Marella)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Santino-Marella-with-the-Cobra-Cropped.jpg><p><a href=#>Santino Marella was never an overly serious wrestler</a> and him having a silly move to go along with that made complete sense. However, putting on a sock puppet cobra and simply prodding people in the face is one of the strangest moves of all time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Funniest Santino Marella Moments In WWE</a></span></p><p>However, Santino would commit 100% to this move every single time and he gave his snake a genuine personality. This resulted in the move becoming incredibly popular with fans, as the audience would go crazy for it every single time.</p><h2 id=the-worm-scotty-2-hotty><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Worm (Scotty 2 Hotty)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Scotty-2-Hotty-sets-up-The-Worm-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Worm was one of <a href=#>the most ridiculous moves</a> in wrestling history, and the fact it took so long to set up only made it even sillier. It was always hard to believe that an opponent would lay down for as long they did in order for Scotty to get this one ready.</p><p>However, despite how goofy the ordeal was, fans would go crazy when he busted it out. The hype was actually the crucial part of it, as it took fans on a journey and brought them in on everything, building it up to the epic moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeinriqv8eiZKysmaO4p63CnmSuppWtvaav056bZqWfq7K0ec%2Bop66kkad6r7vTZpmepJmaw6Z5xqirZqemmr9uw9aeZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frikishi-s-stinkface-9-other-moves-we-can-t-believe-got-over.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frikishi-s-stinkface-9-other-moves-we-can-t-believe-got-over.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frikishi-s-stinkface-9-other-moves-we-can-t-believe-got-over.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frikishi-s-stinkface-9-other-moves-we-can-t-believe-got-over.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frikishi-s-stinkface-9-other-moves-we-can-t-believe-got-over.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frikishi-s-stinkface-9-other-moves-we-can-t-believe-got-over.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./talib-kweli-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./talib-kweli-net-worth-therichest.html>Talib Kweli Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./paul-newman-s-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-life-story.html>Paul Newmans biography, fact, career, awards, net worth &amp;amp; life story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./paul-newman-s-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-life-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
