Jason Derulo is one such legend. It is fascinating to know how Derulo earns and spends his million-dollar fortune. Born in Miramar, Florida, Jason Joel Desrouleaux, popularly known as Jason Derulo, is an American songwriter and singer who achieved success in very little time. Rumors suggest that a considerable chunk of his wealth comes from his <a href=#>popularity amongst fans who love his TikTok posts</a>. Derulo was an early enthusiast when it came to music, and he wrote his first song at the tender age of eight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even as an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">adolescent</a>, he began working as a songwriter for other artists like the song Bossy for New Orleans-based rapper Birdman. He also worked for well-known pop stars, including Diddy, Danity Kane, Donnie Klang, Sean Kingston, Casses, and Lil Wayne. At this point, he was also the producer at Cash Money Records. Derulo is a man of many talents; he got trained in performing arts and became a prolific dancer and performer. He made appearances in the theatre productions of Ragtime and Smokey Joe's Caf√©. After winning the grand prize in the 2006 season of the musical television show Showtime at the Apollo, he was signed by the music producer JR Rotem. After which, he finally got a chance to launch a dazzling career in the music industry.</p><p>Currently, Derulo has a mind-blowing net worth of about $16 million, and here is how the famous TikTok star earns and spends his million dollars fortune.</p><h2 id=earns-prosperous-music-career>Earns: Prosperous Music Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After signing a contract with the minor recording label Beluga Heights, which later came under Warner Music group, Derulo dropped his first ever single called Whatcha Say in 2009. His music was a quick hit, and <a href=#>it topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart</a> with an impressive 54th rank. It eventually made it to the first rank. His first single sold over 5 million copies, and Derulo was already a sensation. This very song also acquired an RIAA certification of triple platinum, and Derulo was just getting started.</p><p>In 2010 he released his debut album featuring his previous singles; this too became a major win selling over 43,000 copies worldwide within the opening week. Derulo became the executive producer of his second album, Future History, released in 2011. This album became a success in the US and topped the charts in Australia, New Zealand, and the UK.</p><p>2014 became a particularly prosperous year for Derulo as he became the most played male artist on the radio. He also released his next album called Tattoos, which was reissued as Dirty Talk, which once again <a href=#>became a commercial success by selling</a> about 44,000 copies within the first week of its release.</p><h2 id=spends-luxury-cars>Spends: Luxury Cars</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like most other rising pop stars, Jason Derulo also likes showing off his wealth.
