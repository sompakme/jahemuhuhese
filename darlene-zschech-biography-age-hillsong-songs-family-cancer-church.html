Darlene and Mark live in the beautiful Central Coast of New South Wales with their three daughters, Zoe, Amy and son-in-law Andrew, Chloe and son-in-law Hosanna, &nbsp;beautiful grand-daughters Ava Pearl, Ruthie Feather and grandson Roman Emmanuel Mark. While they travel extensively and have the honour of working and ministering alongside amazing friends around the globe, the family remains Darlene’s delight.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darlene-zschech-children></span>Darlene Zschech Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Darlene and her husband Mark have three children namely;</p><ul><li>Zoe Zschech</li><li>Chloe Zschech</li><li>Army Zschech</li></ul><p>Darlene Zschech Photo</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darlene-zschech-hillsong></span>Darlene Zschech Hillsong<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zschech was the worship pastor of Hillsong Church from 1996 to 2007, during which time she served as producer, vocal producer or executive producer for more than 20 albums under the Hillsong Music label and wrote more than 80 published worship songs.</p><p>Under Zschech’s leadership, the album People Just Like Us (1994) was the first Christian album in Australia to go Gold as well as the first to go Platinum and the album For All You’ve Done (2004) debuted at #1 on the Australian Record Industry Association album charts.</p><p>Darlene Zschech explained Hillsong Music’s stance in her book Extravagant Worship in a prayer: “Father, let them quickly get their eyes off of us. We just want to point them to you, God, because you are the Author of truth. You are the only One who is to be praised.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hope-unlimited-church></span>Hope Unlimited Church<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In January 2011, Zschech and her husband, Mark, became senior pastors at Church Unlimited, later renamed Hope Unlimited Church, in Charmhaven on the Central Coast.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darlene-zschech-hope-global></span>Darlene Zschech Hope Global<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Darlene Zschech together with her husband Mark work with Compassion International where they serve the world’s poorest of the poor children. In 20004 while on a Compassion trip to Central Africa Mark and Darlene were prompted to initiate “Hope Rwanda: 100 Days of Hope”, a faith-based global initiative that provided hygiene options and education for the citizens of Rwanda, which eventually morphed into Hope Global. According to the official website, Hope Global currently exists to “offer practical solutions to countries devastated by war, genocide, and poverty.”&nbsp; It has major centres in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, and Cambodia, runs long-term development projects, such as Hope Education and the Village of Hope, and has hosted Parramatta Eels trips to Rwanda with CEO Paul Osborne.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darlene-zschech-cancer></span>Darlene Zschech Cancer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In December 2013 Darlene Zschech was diagnosed with breast cancer. She revealed that she was out Christmas shopping in the Sydney CBD, and had popped into the Sydney Breast Clinic on Bathurst Street, to check out a troubling little lump that had already been examined a few times before.</p><p>“Everyone said “it’s nothing, just fatty tissue”,” Darlene told Hope Media’s Emma Mullings in an interview on the NSW Central Coast. But I was having a lot more discomfort than normal. So I went back in. I was with my girlfriend and we thought we’d just drop in, then keep shopping.”</p><p>First came a simple test, then a biopsy, then some results: “inconclusive”. Feeling prompted by God, Darlene stayed for more tests, and a core biopsy confirmed it: cancer.</p><p>“It was a shock,” she said. “We never got our Christmas shopping done, as you can imagine. My husband [Mark] was on his way to preaching in Orange and he just turned around and came home. There were a lot of question marks over the future. A lot of fear. I was good, but I wasn’t good at the same time.”</p><p>Darlene Zschech says cancer diagnoses drove her close to God</p><p>‘Having cancer has driven me closer [to God]. I don’t know how people do it without faith. That has been a gift. I still don’t say “Gee I’m glad I’ve had cancer” because I’m still taking medication, I’ve got another nine years of that and it’s pretty hard going. Life is different now. I live life differently, very intentionally. You can’t be glib.’</p><p>She wrote some songs on her new album ‘Here I Am Send Me’ saying that she would not allow cancer have the last word</p><p>‘There was no way cancer was going to have the last word. I needed to bring these songs [on my new album Here I Am Send Me] and make sure that was going to be the scent in the air over my life and not cancer.’</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darlene-zschech-albums></span>Darlene Zschech Albums<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Revealing Jesus</li><li>The Power of Your Love</li><li>Mighty to save</li><li>You are my Wolrd</li><li>Kiss of Heaven</li><li>Change your world</li><li>Simply darlene</li><li>This is our God</li><li>Glorious ruins</li><li>Songs for communication</li><li>Saviour king</li><li>Here iam/send me</li><li>Christmas</li><li>We have a saviour</li><li>The Power of Your Love Symphony</li><li>You are love</li><li>In Jesus’ Name: A Legacy of Worship & Faith</li><li>Victor’s Crown [Audio Performance Trax]</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darlene-zschech-songs></span>Darlene Zschech Songs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li>Kingdom Come</li><li>Jesus at th centre</li><li>My Jesus i love thee</li><li>Worthy is the Lamb</li><li>Iam yours</li><li>Your are great</li><li>You will be praised</li><li>Magnificent</li><li>Beloved</li><li>Your presence is Heaven</li><li>Here iam send me</li><li>Everything about you</li><li>In Jesus Name</li><li>Victor crown</li><li>Shout to the Lord</li><li>God is here</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darlene-zschech-twitter></span>Darlene Zschech Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darlene-zschech-instagram></span>Darlene Zschech Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darlene-zschech-here-i-am-send-me></span>Darlene Zschech Here I Am Send Me<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h1>Darlene Zschech News</h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darlene-zschech-my-battle-with-cancer-changed-how-i-worship></span>Darlene Zschech: My battle with cancer changed how I worship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Speaking on Premier Christian Radio’s ‘Premier Drive’ show, worship leader Darlene Zschech opened up about her recent battle with cancer.</p><p>Having cancer has driven me closer [to God]. I don’t know how people do it without faith. That has been a gift.</p><p>I still don’t say “Gee I’m glad I’ve had cancer” because I’m still taking medication, I’ve got another nine years of that and it’s pretty hard going. Life is different now. I live life differently, very intentionally. You can’t be glib.</p><p>I get so emotional and passionate when it comes to the worship of God because there were times where I felt like I wasn’t going to make it. Where I felt as though I didn’t have a song, I was scatty in my mind or just completely tired.</p><p>I’ve preached about worship. I have encountered it in many ways, in having a late miscarriage and encountering the presence of God in such a tangible way. But this time it was like worship gave my soul a way to bring praise when, in the natural, I just couldn’t find it.</p><p>The worship of God just came along through many different songs and helped give my heart a voice. I am so grateful for the gift of music. I think that worship gives music its highest purpose. This has been a phenomenal lesson for me.</p><p>When I was being treated a friend wrote out a lot of scriptures for me in a book about the love of God toward me. I travel with that book everywhere to remind myself of the love of God. Because sometimes when you feel disappointed you feel like heaven is silent, that God has forgotten you. You ask: Is he really listening? What is the word really saying?</p><p>Finding the scriptures and having them close by is important so that at any time you can quote the word and bring your experience up to what the word of God says, not try to change your theology down to where you feel. That has been premium for me.</p><p>Another thing has been the people around you. You have to be really vigilant with the people who are in your world.</p><p>I’m quite a soft person, I love people. But after a while people would pray over me and pray these heavy prayers that made me feel so depressed! At the beginning I just stood there and took it. But after a while when people would start to pray like that I would actually stop them and say, “You know what? If you’re not going to pray a prayer of faith then don’t pray over me because I only want people around me who are going to speak life, pray faith, be a sense of joy and hope to my family and church.”</p><p>My daughters would ask, “who are you, Mum?! You have changed so much!”</p><p>I just became really vigilant with the atmosphere that I allowed in my home. And I’m still a bit the same. I live quite differently now and I like it – I don’t know if everyone else around me does, but I do!</p><p>There was no way cancer was going to have the last word. I needed to bring these songs [on my new album Here I Am Send Me] and make sure that was going to be the scent in the air over my life and not cancer.</p><p><strong>Source: www.premierchristianity.com</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyRp7mmusRmsaybmJqwqXnBoqagqpGltbp5wKCcZqCZobm0u82gZKynnpzAbrLApqClsV2Yrq%2BvxKtknKClp7Cpew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdarlene-zschech-biography-age-hillsong-songs-family-cancer-church.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdarlene-zschech-biography-age-hillsong-songs-family-cancer-church.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdarlene-zschech-biography-age-hillsong-songs-family-cancer-church.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdarlene-zschech-biography-age-hillsong-songs-family-cancer-church.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdarlene-zschech-biography-age-hillsong-songs-family-cancer-church.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdarlene-zschech-biography-age-hillsong-songs-family-cancer-church.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./diplo-pulls-a-jay-z-and-answers-all-your-nsfw-questions.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./diplo-pulls-a-jay-z-and-answers-all-your-nsfw-questions.html>Diplo Pulls A Jay Z And Answers All Your NSFW Questions</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./daddy-yankee-announces-his-devotion-to-christ-at-farewell-show.html>Daddy Yankee Announces His Devotion To Christ At Farewell Show</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./daddy-yankee-announces-his-devotion-to-christ-at-farewell-show.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
