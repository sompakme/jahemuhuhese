Oftentimes, sexual relationships are used as a means to not only gain the attention of the public, but to also land coveted roles in Hollywood. While no one likes to speak about backroom casting in the entertainment industry, it’s not just Hollywood execs looking to exploit sexuality.</p><p>This isn’t exactly a new concept or a theme that can only be seen in the entertainment industry, since people are all too familiar with women in the workforce looking to land that next big promotion by sleeping with the boss. However, it becomes a tad more salacious when it involves the Hollywood elite, and the potential to reach international fame. Up-and-coming actresses and models are often known to use this tactic when looking to make a name for themselves and stand out against all the other pretty faces in the world. Yet, it’s not just the directors and producers that call the shots in regard to who becomes famous.&nbsp;Check out our list of 15 celebs who slept around and found fame, and see how some of your favorite celebrities have used their skills in the bedroom to get to the top.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-karrueche-tran---attracts-all-hip-hop-artists><strong>15. Karrueche Tran - Attracts All Hip Hop Artists</strong></h2><p>Karrueche Tran can now be seen on cooking specials with <a href=#>Kylie Jenner </a>or riding motorcycles at Coachella with <a href=#>Christina Milian</a>, but everyone seems to wonder how she became famous in the first place. While her tumultuous relationship with <a href=#>Chris Brown </a>after he split with <a href=#>Rihanna</a> was a huge catalyst in getting her name in the headlines, Brown wasn’t the only man romantically linked to Tran over the years. <a href=#>Ray J</a>, <a href=#>Rob Kardashian</a>, and <a href=#>The Game</a> have all been said to have had “encounters” with Tran; yet it was Chris Brown that ultimately helped to gain her the fame she so desperately craved.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-lindsay-lohan---the-list><strong>14. Lindsay Lohan - The List</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Lindsay Lohan </a>may have started her career as a child actress, but the issues in her personal life have become front and center in the eyes of the public. Romantically linked to a few celebrities in Hollywood, the world didn’t know just how many notches were on her bed post until a very telling In Touch Weekly spread in 2014. Lohan was staying at the Beverly Hilton Hotel and supposedly wrote down names of sexual partners, which was then revealed in the magazine. While some claim the list was fake, it’s impossible to ignore that there is a connection between Lohan and each of the names on the list. Naming 36 famous lovers, Lohan added a new dimension to her already shaky twist to fame.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-kendra-wilkinson---in-and-out-of-the-mansion><strong>13. Kendra Wilkinson - In And Out Of The Mansion</strong></h2><p>When <a href=#>Kendra Wilkinson</a> was first spotted by <a href=#>Hugh Hefner</a> at the tender age of 19-years old, the public wondered what she could possibly see in this grey-haired senior. Although no one was deluded into thinking this was true love, it was a little shocking to hear about what was really going on while she was at The Playboy Mansion. Wilkinson opened up to Access Hollywood about all the nights she would sneak out of the Playboy Mansion, and she also admitted that she was carrying on a romantic relationship with <a href=#>Hank Baskett </a>while she was living there. There were also two separate sex tapes leaked starring Wilkinson, but it only seemed to add to the public interest once she married Baskett and got her own reality show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-rita-ora---20-guys><strong>12. Rita Ora - 20 Guys?</strong></h2><p>While Rita Ora has created a name for herself with a mildly successful music career, most of her fame has come from the controversy surrounding some of the relationships in her personal life. One of her most tumultuous relationships was with Rob Kardashian, with the couple splitting in 2012. Kardashian famously put her on blast on Twitter by saying, “She cheated on me with nearly 20 dudes while we were together, I wonder how many she will sleep with now that we apart? But I mean 20?!!!” Most recently, <a href=#>Beyonce’s </a>Lemonade single referenced, “Becky with the good hair,” which some speculated was about Rita Ora.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-kim-kardashian---what-hasn-t-she-done-for-fame><strong>11. Kim Kardashian - What Hasn't She Done For Fame?</strong></h2><p>Although the daughter of a well-known lawyer, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> didn’t achieve true fame until the release of the sex tape with Ray J. Oftentimes, she is referred to as the celebrity that achieved fame through lying on her back- Kim has become an expert at using her sexuality for profitable gains. Although her dating life is impressive enough due to the sheer number of men on the list, she is most noted for being married three separate times. Her marriage to <a href=#>Kris Humphries </a>only lasted 72 days, and the tabloids are constantly filled with speculation on the current status of marital bliss between her and <a href=#>Kanye West</a>. While she’s definitely made the most out of her 15 minutes, it’s difficult to forget how she got there in the first place.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-paris-hilton---from-one-conquest-to-the-next><strong>10. Paris Hilton - From One Conquest To The Next</strong></h2><p>While <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a> was a regular at all the top Hollywood clubs, she wasn’t famous until the release of her sex tape with <a href=#>Rick Salomon</a>. Coincidentally, the tape was released shortly before the premier of her reality show, The Simple Life, which only heightened the intrigue surrounding this hotel heiress. 1 Night in Paris was a huge catalyst in making Hilton famous, but it definitely wasn’t the end to the long list of sexual partners for this “famous for being famous” socialite. <a href=#>Nick Carter</a>, <a href=#>Benji Madden</a>, and <a href=#>Doug Reinhardt</a> are just a few of the many different men on the arm of Hilton over the years and it doesn’t seem like wedding nuptials are on the horizon any time soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-nicole-murphy---thanks-eddie-murphy><strong>9. Nicole Murphy - Thanks Eddie Murphy</strong></h2><p>While <a href=#>Nicole Murphy</a> has an extensive and accomplished modeling career, she is best known for her tumultuous past relationships. Married to <a href=#>Eddie Murphy</a> for 12 years, the couple had five children together. Since their divorce, Murphy has jumped from one high profile relationship to the next, including television personalities like<a href=#> Nick Cannon</a> and <a href=#>Michael Strahan</a>. Strahan and Murphy had a highly publicized five year long engagement that ended with the couple splitting, but that hasn’t stopped Murphy from continuing to flaunt her bikini-ready body on the beach. While she is no longer a regular on the runway, she’s definitely still trolling for men to maintain her celebrity status.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-erica-mena---unknown-model-to-dating-bow-wow><strong>8. Erica Mena - Unknown Model To Dating Bow Wow</strong></h2><p>Starting off her career modeling for various magazines and music videos, Erica Mena has been romantically linked to a variable who’s who in the music industry. Raul Conde, <a href=#>DJ Envy</a>, Cyn Santana, and <a href=#>Bow Wow </a>are just some of her alleged exes, with various personal drama issues playing out for all to see on Love & Hip Hop New York. Being cast on the show because of her drama-filled personal life, Mena announced she would be leaving the cast to start a reality show with her then-boyfriend, Bow Wow. While the couple never made it to that stage and ultimately split, Mena doesn’t seem like the type to throw in the towel in her search to sleep her way to the top.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-daphne-joy---high-profile-relationships><strong>7. Daphne Joy - High Profile Relationships</strong></h2><p>Although Daphne Joy has had a few roles on the silver screen in films like Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and Frankenhood, the majority of her fame has come from the men she has let into her bed. While hopes were high for her relationship with <a href=#>50 Cent</a>, the couple ultimately split. In the meantime, she moved on pretty quickly to <a href=#>Jason Derulo </a>and became a favorite by paparazzi looking for a smokin’ hot bikini shot on the beach. The couple recently announced their split, but it doesn’t look like Joy will be hard pressed to find a new suitor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-blac-chyna---from-video-vixen-to-being-a-kardashian><strong>6. Blac Chyna - From Video Vixen To Being A Kardashian</strong></h2><p>Black Chyna started off her career starring in numerous music videos for hip hop and rap artists. There shouldn’t be much explaining required on that background, since so much has already been said about how many of those women get their roles. Combining this with various modeling jobs and being a celebrated stripper, Blac Chyna gained true fame through the men she became romantically linked with. Although she had a child with the rapper, <a href=#>Tyga</a>, she is now engaged and pregnant by Rob Kardashian. Rumors are flying about a pending reality show, which shows Blac Chyna has definitely used her sleeping habits to earn an extra rung on the celebrity ladder.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-amber-rose---from-the-pole-to-high-profile-relationships><strong>5. Amber Rose - From The Pole To High Profile Relationships</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Amber Rose</a> has never made any apologies or excuses for her previous time dancing on the pole, but she has definitely utilized the most out of her 15 minutes of fame in the limelight. Starting off in the public eye as arm-candy on the red carpet with Kanye West, she rarely talked and chose to express herself through her scantily clad outfits and signature bald head. Once the couple split, Rose refused to give up her newfound fame. Moving on to<a href=#> Wiz Khalifa</a>, Rose proved she wasn’t about to go back to the pole. Becoming a television personality, collecting child support from Wiz, and creating a huge fan base on social media, it seems like Amber Rose’s stripping days are done.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-kristen-stewart---love-triangles><strong>4. Kristen Stewart - Love Triangles</strong></h2><p>While many actors tend to find love on set, <a href=#>Kristen Stewart’s</a> love life seems to overshadow her talent. Made famous through her sexual relationships, it seems each new conquest brings on even more infamy and press attention. When Stewart started filming the first movie from the Twilight series in Vancouver, she was actually in a four year relationship with then-boyfriend<a href=#> Michael Angarano</a>. Photographed trolling around Vancouver together, Angarano would visit her during filming. The public didn’t label her as a cheating heartbreaker once she became linked to <a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a> because the world became so fascinated with Bella and Edward. Yet, the cheating scandal on Pattinson involving director <a href=#>Rupert Sanders</a> was a little harder to forgive. Nowadays, her acting takes a backseat to who she’s sleeping with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-kate-beckinsale---hooked-up-with-underworld-director><strong>3. Kate Beckinsale - Hooked Up With Underworld Director</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kate Beckinsale</a> is an actress that knows all too well how difficult it is to find a really great role in Hollywood, since many of her early acting roles have been quite forgettable. Films like The Last Days of Disco and The Golden Bowl didn’t exactly become iconic in the eyes of film buffs. So, when she became romantically linked to director <a href=#>Len Wiseman </a>she seemed to finally hit the jackpot. Beckinsale got five starring roles through the Underworld film series, after first meeting Wiseman on set in 2003. Now that the series has concluded, fans shouldn’t be surprised that the couple have split. Perhaps Beckinsale is looking for the next director she can sink her teeth into (no pun intended) to land the next lucrative film series.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-chelsea-handler---hooked-up-with-e-president><strong>2. Chelsea Handler - Hooked Up With E! President</strong></h2><p>When The Chelsea Handler Show debuted in 2006, it was also the year that <a href=#>Handler</a> became romantically linked to the CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group which oversees E!, the network for the show. <a href=#>Ted Harbert</a> became the focus behind many of the comments made against Handler, including the infamous <a href=#>Joan Rivers</a> comment made on <a href=#>Howard Stern’s</a> Siriusxm show. Joan stated, “The girl made it on her back f***ing the president [of E!].” While the couple split in 2010, Handler maintained her relevancy in the tabloids by dating a string of other well-known celebrities like Andre Balazs and 50 Cent.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-julie-chen---affair-with-cbs-president><strong>1. Julie Chen - Affair With CBS President</strong></h2><p>While most affairs are conducted behind closed doors and with hushed voices, the relationship between <a href=#>Julie Chen </a>and CBS President <a href=#>Leslie Moonves</a> was the worst best kept secret in Hollywood. Moonves’ enstranged wife of 24 years, Nancy, has been quite outspoken about their relationship, and was quoted by the Daily News as saying, “I knew our marriage would end eventually. But the way it happened was not correct, it was not moral." In the meantime, Chen went from mistress to wife, and became an even bigger name in Hollywood (mostly on CBS). The host of the CBS show Big Brother, co-anchor on The Early Show on CBS, and of course the CBS talk show, The Talk-&nbsp;many feel that it was her affair that took her to the top.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources: <a href=#>post-gazette</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>dailymail</a></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmptXZiyrbHBrGSwoJ9irq24xKCcnaSpYsCtsc%2BtZJqqn6q7pXnAp5tmnp%2Bqu6V5xZqknmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-celebs-who-allegedly-slept-around-and-found-fame.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-celebs-who-allegedly-slept-around-and-found-fame.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-celebs-who-allegedly-slept-around-and-found-fame.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-celebs-who-allegedly-slept-around-and-found-fame.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-celebs-who-allegedly-slept-around-and-found-fame.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebs-who-allegedly-slept-around-and-found-fame.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./awstin-murawski-awstin-13-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-b.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./awstin-murawski-awstin-13-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-b.html>Awstin Murawski Awstin.13 Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, B</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-rooney-mara-s-father-timothy-christopher-mara-her-age.html>Who is Rooney Mara's Father Timothy Christopher Mara?
