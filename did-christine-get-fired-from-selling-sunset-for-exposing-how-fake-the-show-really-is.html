With that in mind, it makes sense that there have been many <a href=#>“reality” show villains</a> over the years. However, given the fact that “reality” shows are only supposed to portray true events and people rarely are straightforward villains in real life, that seems hard to believe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Did Netflix's 'Selling Sunset' Start?</a></span></p><p>As it turns out, there is a very simple reason why so many “reality” shows have featured outright villains, <a href=#>many "reality" shows have turned out to be surprisingly fake</a>. For example, in an interesting twist, Selling Sunset’s most villainous star Christine Quinn once exposed the “reality” show as being fake. Shortly thereafter, it turned out that <a href=#>Quinn was leaving The Oppenheim Group</a> and the <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> show. Given the timing, many Selling Sunset fans were therefore left wondering if Quinn was fired because she exposed the show as fake.</p><h2 id=how-christine-quinn-exposed-selling-sunset-as-fake>How Christine Quinn Exposed Selling Sunset As Fake</h2><p>In the years since the first episode of Selling Sunset debuted on Netflix in 2019, the show has introduced fans to a long list of fascinating people. In some cases, those people have come off like good, albeit imperfect, human beings. On the other hand, there is no doubt that Christine Quinn has typically come across as the kind of person that most people wouldn’t want to be around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Selling Sunset: Is The Feud Between The Cast And Christine Quinn Real Or Fake?</a></span></p><p>Given the way that Christine Quinn has always come across on television, it was easy to relate to Selling Sunset’s other stars feuding with her all of the time. For example, Quinn always seemed to relish drama including the times that she feuded with one of her Selling Sunset co-stars over her belief that an ex cheated on her with Emma Hernan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though most people can understand holding onto a grudge, some Selling Sunset viewers felt it was strange that Christine Quinn was so fixated on a relationship from the past. In the first hint at what was to come, however, Quinn told Page Six that the drama around Emma Hernan and her ex wasn’t something she would “actually care about”. After making that comment, Quinn implied that she only talked about Herman and her ex so much because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was faking drama for Selling Sunset</a>.</p><p>“Part of being on a reality show is you have to talk about things that you wouldn’t necessarily even give a s–t about in real life, but that’s just the way that it is. So, we all did our best to try to make a good season out of it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Christine Quinn never explicitly stated that Selling Sunset was fake during those comments, she just heavily implied it. However, just before Selling Sunset’s fifth season premiered, Quinn tweeted something that couldn’t have made her contention that the show is fake any clearer. “30 minutes till the launch of #SellingSunset 🥰🥰enjoy the new season and all of its 5,000 fake storylines! 💰 💅,”</p><h2 id=was-christine-quinn-fired-from-selling-sunset-for-exposing-the-show-is-fake>Was Christine Quinn Fired From Selling Sunset For Exposing The Show Is Fake?</h2><p>When Selling sunset’s fifth season reunion premiered, the fact that Christine Quinn didn’t take part in it was extremely notable. During the reunion, it was explained that Quinn was absent because she caught COVID-19. However, many observers believed that Quinn contracting COVID-19 was just an excuse to explain why she wasn’t there.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of Selling Sunset Season 5 Breaks It All Down During Reunion</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In some Selling Sunset fans’ minds, there was one reason why Christine Quinn didn’t show up during the show’s fifth season reunion. The reason they believed that is the case is during the reunion, Quinn’s boss, Jason Oppenheim, explained that there no longer was “a place for her” to work for his real estate brokerage firm. Furthermore, Oppenheim’s statement seemed to imply that Quinn wouldn’t be a part of Selling Sunset going forward.</p><p>Given the fact that Jason Oppenheim has become famous due to Selling Sunset, some people assume that the show’s producers hold a lot of influence over him. If that were true, it is easy to believe that Oppenheim never would have fired Christine Quinn without the approval of Selling Sunset’s bosses. When you factor that idea with the fact that Quinn was fired so soon after she tweeted about the show being fake, some fans assume that the two events are linked. Given the fact pattern, it is easy to see why someone would come to believe that is the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Jason Oppenheim fired Christine Quinn, lots of Selling Sunset fans asked the “reality” star about the situation on social media. In response to one of those people on TikTok, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quinn explained her version of what led to her leaving the Oppenheim Group</a>. “Of course there’s no place for me. I terminated my contract weeks ago prior to filming. I have my own company now lol”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Assuming that Christine Quinn’s explanation for why Jason Oppenheim fired her is true, it is clear that her tweet about Selling Sunset being fake had nothing to do with the situation. In fact, Quinn has even said things during interviews that implied that assumptions that she is leaving Selling Sunset may not be accurate. Of course, being fired in front of the world would embarrass anyone so Quinn may simply be trying to save face. Either way, there is no proof that Quinn was fired due to her revelations about Selling Sunset.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Christine Quinn Was Really Doing Before ‘Selling Sunset’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmLWztdKtoKedXZyytXnFoqmenF2bv7C5jKycpaSZo7Ruv9Snqp6sXZu8s3nEsaeoq5mjtG60zrBkn5mbmnq1tMRmqqGnp2K%2Fpq3LpbBmoaNk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-christine-get-fired-from-selling-sunset-for-exposing-how-fake-the-show-really-is.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-christine-get-fired-from-selling-sunset-for-exposing-how-fake-the-show-really-is.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-christine-get-fired-from-selling-sunset-for-exposing-how-fake-the-show-really-is.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-christine-get-fired-from-selling-sunset-for-exposing-how-fake-the-show-really-is.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-christine-get-fired-from-selling-sunset-for-exposing-how-fake-the-show-really-is.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-christine-get-fired-from-selling-sunset-for-exposing-how-fake-the-show-really-is.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gen-v-season-2-won-t-recast-chance-perdomo-s-role-as-andre-after-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gen-v-season-2-won-t-recast-chance-perdomo-s-role-as-andre-after-death.html>Gen V Season 2 Won't Recast Chance Perdomo's Role as Andre After Death</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cms-to-conduct-2nd-phase-of-testing-drinking-water-for-lead-wsoc-tv.html>CMS to conduct 2nd phase of testing drinking water for lead WSOC TV</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cms-to-conduct-2nd-phase-of-testing-drinking-water-for-lead-wsoc-tv.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
