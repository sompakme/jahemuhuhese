In fact, there are several reasons why she’s the number one actress on television right now. Sofia is hot and we just can’t get enough of her, both on and off the small screen. Her career has never been on fire like this before and she’s just getting started.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many other actresses Sofia’s age worry about their future in Hollywood, she doesn’t. That’s because she doesn’t have to. Plus, she’s a natural beauty, she’s not scandalous, her marriage is the real deal and she’s got pure comedic talent that many actresses would love to have. She knows how to work her attributes and her flaws (although there are so very few of them) to her advantage. She might not show it at times, but the woman is smarter than you think.</p><p>Check out our list of 15 reasons why Sofia Vergara is (and will always be) one of the best actresses on television. Because let’s face it – she’s smart, she’s witty, and she’s not bad on the eyes, either. Take a look at our list below and let us know what you think!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-a-natural-beauty><strong>She’s&nbsp;A Natural Beauty</strong></h2><p>There’s no denying that <a href=#>Sofia Vergara</a> is one of the hottest women on the planet right now. I mean, the woman just gets better looking every damn&nbsp;year. And unlike many other stars in Hollywood, she looks exactly the same way she did twenty years ago. We’re not kidding here. The woman is a goddess. Even without makeup, she looks flawless. A lot of people can’t say that. But it’s a gift that Sofia has and one that she’s proud of, too.</p><p>And in case you were wondering, her current proportions have been the same way since she was a teenager. And she has the pictures to prove it, too. She once said, “If you're asking if my breasts are natural, yes, this is how I've looked since I was 13 years old.”</p><h2 id=her-marriage-is-the-real-deal><strong>Her Marriage Is The Real Deal</strong></h2><p>I’ll admit that I was one of those critics (like so many other people) who initially thought that Sofia’s relationship with Joe Manganiello was a public sham. I mean, let’s be honest here. These two are just too good looking for their own good. Seriously, it should be illegal for two ridiculously good looking people to be together. Their beauty is blinding and honestly, it’s just not fair for the rest of us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With that being said, I’m glad that I got Sofia and Joe totally wrong. Because they’ve proved to us all that their marriage is the real deal. Words and actions are one thing, but you can tell by their body language that they totally support one another. And we can only hope that they’ll manage to make it for the long haul.</p><h2 id=she-s-got-comedic-talent><strong>She’s Got Comedic Talent</strong></h2><p>We don’t often say this about a lot of Hollywood actresses out there, but Sofia Vergara is one who definitely has great comedic talent. The woman is downright hilarious. And quite frankly, there’s no one that can compare to her in the entertainment industry right now. She’s funny and she’s beautiful. Sofia Vergara is a full package.</p><p>The Latina beauty famously once said, “You know, I was the class clown in Catholic school, but I never thought I would make a living out of it!” Ha! And she’s making quite a living off of it, too. Sofia is estimated to be worth about $100 million dollars. She earns about $37 million dollars per year in her work and her side businesses. Keep the jokes coming, Sofia. They are worth every penny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-one-can-compare-to-her><strong>No One Can Compare To Her</strong></h2><p>Have you noticed that there’s really no one else like Sofia Vergara in the entertainment world right now? That’s because there’s no one like her. Yes, she’s beautiful. Yes, she’s got great talent. But she’s also one of a kind, and that’s what makes her extra special.</p><p>Also, Sofia has made it no secret that she’s still learning something new everyday and that she’s basically in a league all of her own, thanks to her quirky personality and her famous Latina accent. Speaking about how she looks for roles, Sofia once explained, “It has to be a very specific role for me because of my accent. I can't complain; I've been working since I got to LA. But it is hard. I have no training as an actress so I try whatever I do like school, because I'm learning.”</p><h2 id=she-doesn-t-get-into-feuds><strong>She Doesn’t Get Into Feuds</strong></h2><p>Just recently, reality television star <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a> called out Sofia Vergara for giving her the cold shoulder. She also said that for an “immigrant” (Teresa’s words) she expected Sofia to be a little nicer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I mean, we don’t know exactly what went down between them or who shunned who, but Sofia took the high road by not responding to Teresa’s petty words. She could have easily defended herself, but Sofia knows that it would be a tit-for-tat situation. Instead, she showed class by ignoring the situation altogether. And why shouldn't she? Sofia has better things to worry about than a Real Housewives of New Jersey star that she’s never really seen before. Plus, Sofia doesn’t really care about what her critics have to say. The people that make up her fan base are the only ones that matter.</p><h2 id=she-has-a-wicked-sense-of-humor><strong>She&nbsp;Has A Wicked Sense Of Humor</strong></h2><p>The best thing about Sofia Vergara has to be her wicked sense of humor. There’s really no one like her. The woman can tell a good joke in two languages&nbsp;and better yet, poke fun at herself. And do you know a lot of women in Hollywood that have done that? I didn’t think so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also once poked a little fun at her co-star <a href=#>Ed O'Neill</a>’s old character, Al Bundy from this mega hit show, Married With Children. She dressed up as Al’s wife, Peggy Bundy for Halloween a few years ago and absolutely nailed the costume. It was perfect. It’s great to see that she has a good relationship with Ed, both on and off screen. With that being said, Sofia even makes Peggy Bundy look incredibly hot. Ha!</p><h2 id=she-gets-along-with-her-co-stars><strong>She Gets Along With Her Co-Stars</strong></h2><p>I’m sure we’ve heard plenty of stories of behind-the-scenes feuds between co-stars on the sets of some of our favorite Hollywood movies and television shows. No one wants to admit to it, but when two Hollywood divas clash, you see more than just fireworks. But with Sofia, that’s not the case at all. Why? Because her co-stars actually love her and get along with her quite well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, that doesn’t mean that Sofia doesn’t have her bad days. The woman does get upset like the rest of us. But she doesn’t hold grudges for very long. Sofia said, “Oh yes, things get me mad. But the thing is, I get mad, and then I turn around and I forget.” Seriously, how can you not love this woman? She’s just&nbsp;perfect.</p><h2 id=she-s-versatile><strong>She’s Versatile</strong></h2><p>She’s a model, she’s an actress, and she’s a businesswoman. In other words, Sofia Vergara is the full package. She’s also a very versatile actress, as she can easily switch from television work to the big screen with ease. And you can’t say that about everyone in Hollywood. Sofia is also pretty flexible when it comes to changing her looks and appearance for her roles.</p><p>She also once said, “Yes, I'm blonde. When I started as an actor, because of the accent and my body and my personality, it was not what the stereotype of the Latina woman in Hollywood is, so they didn't know where to put me. The blond hair wasn't matching. The moment I&nbsp;made&nbsp;my hair dark, it was better for my work.” And she hasn’t looked back (or blonde) ever since. Hey,&nbsp;if it works, it works, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-ageless><strong>She’s Ageless</strong></h2><p>We’ve already talked about how beautiful Sofia Vergara is (and if you don’t agree with that statement, you need to get your eyes checked. The woman is the definition of hotness). But what fascinates us the most about Sofia is that she is absolutely ageless too. Everyone around her seems to be getting older each year except Sofia. She must be taking shots from the Fountain of Youth with her morning coffee because she’s managed to reverse the ageing process totally.</p><p>She’s also not into any botox or plastic surgery trends. She said, “L. A. is crazy. The women all look the same now. That thing with the cheeks,&nbsp;like Madonna. Who do they think they're fooling? It doesn't make them look young. You end up looking like a freak.” We couldn’t agree with her anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-reaches-out-to-two-markets><strong>She Reaches Out To Two Markets</strong></h2><p>I know that a lot of people have criticized Sofia Vergara for her exaggerated Latina accent on Modern Family. But according to the actress, she does it for a reason. And no, she’s not being offensive at all. She just wants to stay true to her roots, and her character will provide a few laughs along the way, too. And the best part is that she can do this both in English and Spanish. Talk about a double (but comedic) threat.</p><p>You could also call Sofia Vergara a trailblazer as she’s paved the way for other Latina actresses to find more work on television. She said, “I never thought I would get such a perfect role in Modern Family. A lot of TV shows now are looking for more Latin women.”</p><h2 id=she-s-not-a-diva><strong>She’s Not A Diva</strong></h2><p>I’m sure we’ve all heard more than a handful of stories of Hollywood actresses acting like complete divas behind the scenes. To date, we’ve never heard any stories of Sofia being difficult to work with. You’d think she would walk around with a crew of assistants who are taking care of all her needs, but nope. That’s not the case at all. Simply put, Sofia Vergara doesn’t act like a diva who expects to have the red carpet rolled out for her everywhere she goes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sofia is the kind of woman that rolls with the punches. But at the same time, she does admit that she needs a little assistance in doing some basic day-to-day things like making coffee. She said, “Listen, I didn't know how to make coffee when I came to the United States,&nbsp;because in Colombia the maids do it.”</p><h2 id=no-scandals><strong>No Scandals</strong></h2><p>With the exception of her ex Nick Loeb trying to destroy her life with his ongoing frozen embryo legal battle, Sofia doesn’t get into any ridiculous feuds or scandals. She steers clear from anything that might put her name in the negative headlines. She’s too focused on her career and her family to deal with any pettiness.</p><p>Yet, it seems like Nick is determined to make her life hell, one way or another. He wants to raise their frozen embryos as his two daughters, which means that Sofia would have to stay connected to him for the rest of her life. And that’s the last thing she wants to do right now. Yet Nick is determined to be a parent, whether Sofia agrees to it or not. Talk about a nightmare situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-should-get-a-modern-family-spin-off><strong>She&nbsp;Should Get A Modern-Family Spin-Off</strong></h2><p>I’m surprised that no one has really thought about this before, but it’s without a doubt that Sofia Vergara should definitely get her own Modern Family spin-off show. It’s without a doubt that viewers would definitely tune in no matter what. Because let’s face it, her character Gloria steals every scene that she’s in. The woman is intentionally and unintentionally funny. We would love to see a spin-off show happen. It would definitely become one of the highest rated shows on television.</p><p>Plus, Sofia is also extremely ambitious. She once said, “I still haven't played a leading role in cinema or in TV, and that's something that I long for.” We have a feeling that it’s still going to happen, and Sofia has only gotten started. There’s so much more to come from her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-realistic><strong>She’s Realistic</strong></h2><p>Sofia knows that she plays into a certain stereotype, and she’s not afraid to admit to it. In fact, she embraces it. She knows that she’s a huge Hollywood star thanks to the characters that she’s played and her funny Latina girl persona. Plus, it sure has helped that she’s got dangerous curves that no one can come close to touching. Sofia is hot and she knows it and according to the actress, it’s not a bad thing at all. In other words, she’s realistic about her image and how she is portrayed in her work and in the media.</p><p>She once said, “I think that would be ungrateful if I were upset because I'm seen as attractive or sexy. That's opened so many doors for me in my life.”</p><h2 id=she-s-a-girl-s-girl><strong>She’s&nbsp;A Girl’s Girl</strong></h2><p>Sofia Vergara is one Hollywood actress who loves her girlfriends. She’s got plenty of them and is definitely a girl’s girl. No man can get in between her and her girlfriends. She takes time out of her busy schedule to show her friends that her relationships with them are important to her, and that’s what we love the most about her. It’s a great quality that makes her beautiful, both inside and out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, she also supports women as women, regardless of where they come from, who they are, or what their size or shape is for that matter. She’s not into super skinny trends. She also takes pride in her curves. She explained, “In Latin America, women are supposed to be voluptuous. They don't believe that you have to be skinny to be attractive.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2nsqK%2FzqeqZq%2BYrnq0u8WimGaulae0or7AZqCsZaSdsm6uxKyrZqyYnruoec6nZK2uXae2qLTTZqWor18%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-reasons-why-sofia-vergara-is-the-best-thing-on-tv-right-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-reasons-why-sofia-vergara-is-the-best-thing-on-tv-right-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-reasons-why-sofia-vergara-is-the-best-thing-on-tv-right-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-reasons-why-sofia-vergara-is-the-best-thing-on-tv-right-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-reasons-why-sofia-vergara-is-the-best-thing-on-tv-right-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-reasons-why-sofia-vergara-is-the-best-thing-on-tv-right-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./china-anne-mcclain-net-worth-how-much-is-china-anne-mcclain-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./china-anne-mcclain-net-worth-how-much-is-china-anne-mcclain-worth.html>China Anne McClain Net Worth How Much Is China Anne McClain Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./where-is-hunter-lee-soik-now.html>Where is Hunter Lee Soik Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./where-is-hunter-lee-soik-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
